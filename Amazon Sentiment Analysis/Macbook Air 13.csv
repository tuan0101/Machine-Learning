0,4.0 stars,"  Okay. So you have been seeing people display their Macbooks and you have always fancied owning one of those premium devices. Now, as Amazon offers this Macbook Air at a reduced price, you are getting tempted to buy this. STOP and consider what you get for the money you spend. Do not buy this if you think this adds some premiumness to your profile. It will not - because this device is next in line where support will be withdrawn by Apple. Resist temptation - because THAT is what Apple sells. The last reason to buy should be your feeling that it improves your profile. Apple users will smirk when they see you with an obsolete 'dinosaur' device as they display their latest toys.If you are a windows user - better go to some friend's Macbook and try some activities. MAC OS is great till you try to change something as puny as your mouse cursor!! You realise that you are stuck in the little cozy jail of Apple once you try anything non-standard. Try transferring data by a USB stick from your other laptop to this one .... you will need training. USB partitioning has to be only ExFAT - and evn if you do this partitioning on a MAC, chances are that Windows will not recognise the USB stick. If you are not a power user - this can be a real pain. Of course, you can pretend (like so many thousands of Apple users) that these do not matter. But hey - they do. A premium DELL or HP may be the best option for you. (Yes, I will first discourage you from buying this and then explain why I purchased this for myself)Know that you are giving up the option of buying RAM or SSD from the neighbouring shop to extend the device life. You wil depend on Apple and on Apple alone. Of course there are generic spares - but these too are more expensive than the DELL or HP spares. Once Apple pulls the plug of support, these spares may get even more expensive. In fact, hardware upgrade beyond increasing the SSD is very much a rare luxury. Thankfully, I have kept myself out of this snob-race that Apple peddles.If you are still reading - here are the good sides (why I purchased this in spite of what I wrote above)A Mac is a Mac is a Mac. So is this one. The hardware are perfectly matched and performance is always optimal. This laptop is for carrying along as a second laptop, alongside my official one, a DELL workhorse. MAcbook Air is lightweight and can run other operating systems. I use this to run Windows and Linux.The MAC OS is a very stable Operating system. Chances are that you will never face a single crash in your lifetime of using this Macbook Air. Windows is fragile (too many bugs and updates) and Linux is difficult (you need a little training). That's where the Macbook Air comes in Handy. With Parallels desktop, you can load Linux and Windows on Virtual Machines on the Mac. You can seamlessly go from one OS to another without rebooting. However, note that with 'parallels desktop' you are operating Windows and Linux from your little cell in the Apple jail. And be prepared to shell out a good amount to ""buy"" this software. It is possible to load linux differently so that it works outside the Apple shell. Quite a saving grace. Using BootCamp (through a dual bootng feature), you can take advantage of the multi-tasking power of Windows without the risk of getting blue screens or hanged functions. So overall that looks great.Now coming back to my rating... I run mostly Windows and Linux on this MAC. Happy with it because the hardware is great. I consider myself a power user - so I know that I can find alternatives for this if and when Apple pulls the plug of support (should be available for at least another year, and a certain period after that as Apple's support to ""obsolete"" devices). Hence a durability rating of 3 stars only !!That (above) is the truth laid bare. Please decide and buy at your own risk.~~ Buy this if you like the hardware (but know that DELL or HP would give a much better hardware at this price, and those will be upgradable and last much longer than this)~~ Buy this because you understand that this hardware is very stable and Mac OS can protect your windows as it works in the MAC Shell. Buy this because you can run Linux once Mac makes this obsolete.~~ Do not buy this if you feel it adds to your premium value. It will be a dinosaur soon and you will be left stranded. Think of the plight of iPhone 5, which was premium 24 months ago. People rushed and purchased their ""cheap iPhone"" around a year back. Today, they have no pride in showing off a device that is obsolete. Tomorrow, Apple will make it sluggish and they will be forced to upgrade.EDIT/ADD [02/12/2019]: If you plan to upgrade your SSD to 500GB, please look at SSD (ASIN:B07J2WBKXF) with adapter (ASIN: B07D7VM8GM). I have been able to successfully upgrade myself. Review is on the SSD page."
1,5.0 stars,  It's amazing..... battery last around 10 -12 hrs.....best laptop for students and coders
2,5.0 stars,"  Finally a MacBook possession. Got it in 50k in Diwali sale. Technically good laptop.Good News.luxury product, niche technology, good battery life, reliable machine (other laptops crash and become defunct in 6-10 years), no anti-virus required, security of data and transactions much better. Terrific sense of possession & pride.Bad News. Problems will be there if you are switching from windows based system - very less space in hard disk, no CD drive, inability to transfer data from Mac to your existing external hard disc unless you format it, apps are mostly paid and re unreasonably expensive (no free apps which are available otherwise on google play store, even the angry bird costs Rs 400 !!), all printers are not compatible (e.g. the most economical MFD laser printer RICOH SP 111 can't be used), huge compatibility issues with Pages (MS Word) and Keynote (powerpoint) unless you master it by working on these (still mostly the document and slides either do not open in windows environment or have distortion issues). you need to spend extra for an external CD writer and tp buy a carry bag. Mac con not be connected to most of the projectors unless you buy some connectors, which are expensive and theres no clarity which one to buy and from where. you can't connect it to your TV, the ports are different and again theres no clarity - customer support, manuals or help section are silent ! Marketing strategy for Indian market, if at all has been planned, has been very bad. If these critical issues (and a few more not mentioned here) are handled properly, the Mac can sweep away other laptops in India. Presently, it doesn't seem to be happening.Overall Verdict.If compatibility issues mentioned above do not bother you, go for it. Else, think hard.  If its an emotional issue to own a long cherished Mac, then its a different thing. Go ahead and gradually you would figure out most (but not all) of the above problems, like I did."
3,1.0 stars,"  We buy macbook's expecting that it will lasts at least 3 years, not in my case they are saying it will costs 46000rs to repair.. i bought this in 58000rs.. if i don't want to repair it still I've to pay 2500rs as diagnostic cost.. not recommended.."
4,5.0 stars,"  Best Laptop under 60k. If you don't want any accounting softwares like tally or busy then go for it, better than windows in every term. I just love it's battery life with sleek look üòçNow talking about MS officeIt's available on app store, free for 1 monthAfter that you will have to pay.You cannot install pirated version but if you install Windows 7 or any other version then u can use Ms office for freeBut in MacBook there are other apps which are good substitute for Ms office appsNumbers for ExcelPages for wordKeynote for PowerPointAnd you can convert your numbers file to Excel file or csv fileSame for the pages & keynoteSo no need of Ms office for me.Cons1. U cannot play games, your laptop will just heat up, battery will drain* U cannot play pubg mobile on emulator if you are pubg loverüòÅ2. Storage 128gb, it will work fine but if you want to store movies or TV shows u can't, u have to buy external hard disk"
5,5.0 stars,  Pros:1. Light weight and super fast response time2. Highly optimize which avoids any kind of process lag.3. Beautiful looks and feels like a prime product.4. Long battery life and awesome sound clarity5. Purchased during Amazon sale cost around 52k.Cons:1. Not enough memory2. Limited softwares available3. Operating system is not that user-friendlyProbably one of the best option for 50k+ laptops
6,1.0 stars,"  I am very upset about the product as I checked my MacBook 15 days back in December, it didn‚Äôt start. It was luckily in warranty . I took it to the service centre and they informed me the mother board and battery collapsed. If it was not in warranty I had to pay 47000/. I asked for replacement of the product and I was refused. They got it fixed for me. I don‚Äôt know why should I pay 57000/ for Mac quality. If this is the quality and the service, then I have to go to other product. In January my product expiry was due. They have give an extension of 3 months warranty when I had asked for 1 year. Very disappointed."
7,1.0 stars,"  Bought this product recently on 5 April, was working perfectly fine for few days and on 16 April the Mac working charge or turn on. Apple service centre says they can‚Äôt fix the product under warranty and amazon in try to come up with a solution ever since , no solid answer . I m stuck with a dead mac after using it for 10days. Request seller , Amazon or apple to take full responsibility."
8,4.0 stars,"  I have been a Macbook pro user for last 2 years. I came across the new Macbook air and got a chance to put hands on it. So here is a brief review on my first impressions. Basically i will be comparing this with a regular laptop of similar price range and Macbook PROAir benefits compared to Non Apple laptop:# Slim and light weight for daily travel# 10-11 hours battery backup on normal usage# Apple touch pads are awesome, smooth and responsive compared to any premium laptop# Audio quality on speakers is good, but not as loud as my Macbook Pro 13# Apple front camera works the best in low light, best for low light skype calls# SSD - Apps launch very fast despite the low power processor# Metal body construction# Mag safe charger- If you are really careless this helps very much.# Ambient light sensor that adjusts brightness automatically ( Many people are not aware of this feature)# Keep your Air closed or leave somewhere idle and check back after 2 or 3 days, you will see battery has dropped less than 3 or 4 %# The best part - Mac OS, contains all that you need, a neat calendar, Todos app, notes, Quicktime, Mail app etc. Hassle free OSAir demerits compared to Non Apple laptop:# Performance is on lower side# Good for basic usage only, internet, movies, video calls, spreadsheets, mail# You will get better display(Full HD) if you buy a 999$ Ultrabook from US (In India they come at premium)Should you consider Macbook PRO? - PRO advantagesI know a lot of people might be confused whether to go with PRO for some additional bucks. So listing benefits of pro from my experience# Force touch - More comfortable touch pad, less finger pain compared to buttons on Air, Adjustable pressure# Retina display - More pixels, Better viewing angle. Air is 1440x900 while PRO is 2560x1600 pixels# Better performance - Pro CPU is actually about 50% faster than AIR, but in real world tests, apps launch at similar speed in both PRO and Air. The difference is notable only when you run CPU intensive tasks like Programming, Video encoding, Photo editing, Raw conversion etc. Those who are not into this can go with Air and save some money.# Newer CPU - Macbook air has not evolved much compared to PRO. The 2017 Air uses the same fifth generation CPU as the previous version (2015). But with a little upgrade in CPU speed. ie 1.6 GHz to 1.8 GHz. The newer PROs come with 7th generation Intel processors. The difference is mainly with the energy consumption.# HDMI port - You don't need display port adaptor# New keyboard - The 2016 PRO has the same keyboard as the ""Macbook"". Keys are less deeper and more wider. This makes it little more comfortable to type. Air comes with the same old keyboard as 2015 PRO# Wider touch pad - Not a big deal. But if someone loves that, its a bonus# Color options - Yes, Air is only available in Silver, PRO comes in 3 color optionsIf you think, all the above justifies the price difference between the PRO and Air, go for the PRO. The only benefit that Air offers is battery life. PRO offers 8-9 hours only, while Air offers, 11-12 hours battery.Whom Air is for?Macbook air is not a gaming machine or for hard core users. Its for people who love to watch lot of movies, work on documents, browse and some basic programming. When i say programming, Xcode works fine on Macbook air. But Software like Android studio, Photoshop seems to struggle a little on Air. But if you are once in a while user of intensive apps, you can ignore this.I will update my review with more details after a few weeks of hands on testing and usage. If you have any queries leave a comment below. I will try to answer in a day or two.Thanks for reading! Hope this helps.Also, Get 10% Cashback by Ordering through vqr .in/24"
9,1.0 stars,"  Hi, Think thousand time before buying. One calm night i was cuddling in jaipuri blanket while enjoying youtube on this expensive machine. Cold night and little excitement created electrostatic charge which spike though spaceBar button. that's how it went to deep sleep forever. Nothing can bring it back and i am in no mood in spending another fortune on this machine. Apple, of you (i)care, this is the least of security feature included in all electronic devices. And the best part, it was a week after Warranty expiration date."
10,1.0 stars,  Never purchase any Apple products. I bought 3 and start giving problems just after 6 months. I need to visit 4 times service station which is far 12 km. Again MacBook start acting dead after 6 more months. Mean a top priced laptop giving problems in every 6 months.I have good experiences with other brands of laptops. I hope this comment can help to save somebody‚Äôs money.
11,4.0 stars,  I use this for music production and it works awesome..however the display is not so good as it should have been in a 63k laptop
12,1.0 stars,  Reason for 1 star is I ot an defective piece. The sound quality was not good . My laptop started giving issues with power button from  4 months. The screen would flicker and it would shutdown automatically after sometime. Took the mac to service centre. They replaced the motherboard free of cost as it was in warranty. Now my mac is perfectly fine :
13,1.0 stars,"  I bought MacBook air in 2017, it was working fine till last month. It suddenly stopped charging I took it apple care and was shocked to hear the feedback. They told me that the motherboard is dead and i have to buy a new motherboard. The cost was 50k ( i bought at 53k in 2017). We buy Apple products because they are meant to be long-lasting. I am really disappointed and would prefer other companies next time. They earn extra money from selling an extended warranty."
14,1.0 stars,  I bought it last year from Amazon during Sale. It worked well for on year and then suddenly stopped working. I am unable to switch it on. I took it to service centre and they told that the logic board has to be replaced. The cost is around 45000. I am helpless. I dont want to invest more into that. I used the laptop very carefully but I think Amazon sent a defected piece on sale.
15,5.0 stars,  All are Gud.. For now..
16,1.0 stars,"  Bought this MacBook for 51K in 2018 and 2 weeks back my laptop stopped working without the adaptor even at 100% I went to the Apple Store and they informed me that the logic board had corrosion and it would cost me 42K to get it replaced. Just after my warranty of a year expired, this issue came up. Highly not recommended. This was a defective piece and very conveniently Amazon/Apple sold a product that would last more than a year (the warranty) time just to have customers pay almost just as much to fix the laptop. I was major fan of Apple and its products but now I am really disheartened. I hate what happened. Cannot spend a dime on any Apple product ever again. PLEASE read this review before buying the product. Amazon/Apple PLEASE SELL BETTER PRODUCTS AND DO NOT PLAY WITH CUSTOMERS AND THEIR MONEY"
17,3.0 stars,  White line coming on screen in just three months of purchase from amazon. Doubting the quality of the products sold on amazon
18,1.0 stars,  It worked only for a year. A year + 1 day it stopped working and apple has the worst customer service.No solutions
19,4.0 stars,"  Got the Apple Macbook air on amazon discount sale.1) The OS is smooth and is a breeze to work with. Ships with macOS sierra but update is available to macOS mojave2) The design and build quality, as you can expect from an apple product is top notch.3) Excellen sound quality, keyboard.Cons:1) 128GB may be low incase you want to have movies and media in your laptop.You need to carry around a hard disk that kind of nullifies the advantage of having a light weight laptop.2) Display resolution is not exactly upto the mark"
20,2.0 stars,"  Bought it on 9th July, stopped working / not turning power on by 4th Nov. Adding to this disappointment is - Apple's refusal to repair it under warranty stating that there is corrosion in Logic Board. Amazon also did not help. The seller - Appario - does not like to be bothered with it. Sometimes I wonder if buying electronics online is a good idea!"
21,5.0 stars,  Good purchase of mineBest for programming...Only some heating issues...but can be ignored!!
22,1.0 stars,"  Stopped working before I could repay the EMI's. Just after the warranty expired, the laptop refused to turn on. Apple repair center asks Rs 43000 for spare part. I am throwing it in trash and never buying an apple product again."
23,4.0 stars,"  Apple,apple,apple, thats the first thing that must have flashed in you mind when you saw this product, so here i have a total breif review on the laptop...***Pros***4k Video Editing with Final Cut Pro X on this thing works like butter, there is heating issue that i am going to go to apple service center to get it checkedEveryday works like checking mail and is just gr8The Battery is just OVERPOWERED, works for around 11-12 hours on continuous work and 8-9 hours when editingThe graphics card scores 30 fps in cinebench which is not that badThe performance is also fine, 280 cb processor score on cinebenchSpeakers are really good with perfect bass, its a laptop speaker, dont expect much from itDisplay brightness is 300 nits, which is fineThe Wi-Fi is extremely good, can get a network even from the living room while the router is in the bedroomVery thin and lightweightMacOS is good for School work if you know all the office applications for mac, for eg.Pages is WordMagSafe 2 is the best partGood Trackpad and Keyboard with backlightThe Storage is fast!, thanks to the M.2 based SSD!***Cons***Display, though the resolution is ok for a 13.3 inch display, the viewing angle is not appropriate for a 84k laptopGets heated up (Going to get it checked by apple support). Cooling not appropriate for this cpu, need a better thermal paste and fanRam management on MacOS Mojave is not good, 8 GBs of memory is not well distributed among all tasks running in backgroundMacOS is not made for gaming, you need to boot camp on this mac with Windows if you are really a hard-core gamerIntel HD integrated graphics at the price???, god damn it apple (Though its not bad, have seen GeForce 940MX at the same price)No Force trackpadBezels are way too thick in today's standardsNo thunderbolt 3 or Usb CCan't detect Android Devices until Android Device Explorer is installedThe Storage is less! (128 GB, will upgrade to 256 GB in a few years)***My Verdict***This devices is for them who want Battery and Power, and people who want to do Video Editing on Final Cut Pro X, if anyone has a heat up issue than you should Call apple Support and visit one service center immediately to get your laptop checked! Though the graphics is OK from my view, apple could have given better graphics like the radeon vega 8 graphics or Intel Iris Plus or Pro for a laptop that is so expensive! Everything else is Great! And MacOS is not that hard, i easily use both my Lenovo Gaming PC and my apple macbook air easily! Go for it if you are in the criteria I explained above! For hard-core video editing I would recommend atleast an iMac 4k or MacBook Pro Base Model because of its cooling Fan structure, Better Graphics and CPU! This Air is still not enough to edit 4k60fps videos! While exporting the 4k60fps video the CPU and GPU went up to 104 degrees, this is the reason i am going to apple support! Thank You if you read the whole review because I spent a lot of time writing this!*Update on 8 Oct, 2019*Apple service did nothing, so I thought of doing my own service! Yes, I changed the thermal paste and dusted the fan, now, everything is running even better than ever, even the heating issua is solved! Now while exporting a 4k 60 fps video, it's just around 80 degrees, hence no thermal throttling, Yay!"
24,1.0 stars,"  For a full year until the warranty was valid, this MacBook Air worked like a charm. Then it died. No response to power button. No internal mechanical movement. The laptop is just dead. I gave it for repair at an Apple authorized service center and they told me it was a failed Power Section and IC. I paid Rs. 13,300 for replacement and service charge of these parts only for the laptop to run fine for a couple of days and then die out in th same way. The dealer says I would have to pay the same amount to get the parts replaced again with no guarantees that the issue won't turn up again. Never trusting an Apple product again. For such a rich money hogging brand, they offer the shoddiest quality of service and products ever."
25,5.0 stars,"  There's a reason why people vouch for Mac books and I doubt it out now.... Excellent build quality, not only if the laptop but also of the accessories, the battery life is good, and sound is awesome. The look and feel of the product is just excellent. A 5 star in every aspect."
26,1.0 stars,  In 3 Days of Use The Laptop stopped working and not powering on.
27,1.0 stars,"  Was shocked to received a defective Apple MacBook. The device was not booting. Amazon was prompt in sending service Engineer, who certified the item defective. This item was replaced with a brand new MacBook as per Amazon policy. However to my dismay, this new MacBook also had a similar defect, which was again certified by the service Engineer. Apple is the world leader in laptops, and what amazes me is the 'QC' or the lack of it.Finally I had to request Amazon to refund the amount, which they did."
28,1.0 stars,"  I bought it last year from Amazon during Sale. It  suddenly stopped working twice in span of 1.5 yrs. I am unable to switch it on. After three months of purchase, I took it to service centre and they told that the logic board has to be replaced. The cost is around 45000. Luckily it was in the warranty. Now again after a eight month of replacement, it's dead again. I am helpless. I dont want to invest more into that. I used the laptop very carefully but I think Amazon sent a defected piece on sale."
29,1.0 stars,"  My experience was little bitter in a sense that for my Mac, USB port is not working. Took my newly bought Mac to Apple Service centre. they have checked and come up with comment ""USB port is not working"". However I believe they might have tried all possible option of software upgrade, iTunes upgrade etc, cable shuffle to work out but nothing works well. so Returning this machine and looking after replacing it with correct one."
30,1.0 stars,"  I purchased this product in February 2018 from Amazon. The power button started giving problems in end-May 2019. The computer just would not startup. I scanned the Net for such problems.  A lot of work arounds: push the Start button+ shift button etc. This worked for a few days. Then such work around too stopped working at all - the computed refused to start-up once shut down. Surprisingly, I ran the computer diagnostics on the Macbook, and the diagnostics program could not find any defect! I was surprised that even if the program could not find a defect on the computer, yet the computer once shut down would not start up.Secondly, finding a  Macbook authorised service center too is an onerous task in India. The Service center informed me that there is a problem with the mother board. And it needs to be replaced. Wow! Next time I would stick to my windows notebook, would never purchase a Macbook again!"
31,3.0 stars,"  I am writing this review after 3 yrs. It was a great feeling when I purchased this laptop and it was a big ambition too... Why it can't be? People were looking at me with a great look when I carry this Mac along with me to office or to public places. It was again a great experience of speed, look, weight, logo, and u name anything u want, u have it...However, after 3 years, the problem suddenly came up. My Keypad and Mouse tracker both failed working and the reason was not known. I tried with customer care too to find a solution, however after spending an hr, I found no solution. Finally the CC suggested me to take it to Service centre. The CC person informed me that they will do resetting the mac but all in vain. For that they charged Rs.1800/-Then after 2 days they told that keypad need to be replaced which will cost Rs.25000/- then again for the Trackpad which will be around Rs.10000/-So totally it is Rs.35000/- (approx)Now the people whoever are reading this review, need to calculate there financial issues and then plan to go ahead. Moreover, I felt it is not so user friendly laptop and it has many restrictions. Eg-Connect Android Mobile to Mac...The cost of Display will be Rs. 49000/-.. Just think about it and then go ahead.Suggestion: For those who are crazy of Apple like me but with financial issues, then my suggestion will be ""BIG NO"".If u have no financial problems then it is ur choice... But still I say to them ""why do u spend"" so much when u have other FHD options available with better specifications???"
32,4.0 stars,  Thanks to amazon for superb timeliness and hassle-free delivery. Original item received. Properly packed for safety and kudos to the exchange offer i got it in somewhat lesser price. Still there are a few things or two like the caps lock key is being non responsive sometimes which might not be amazon's fault but still..its amazon who is in between. Overall the product is good. I'm fully satisfied with the performance and battery life. It actually gives upto 12 hours of battery life while you do small modular works.
33,2.0 stars,"  Apple Products are usually good, perform well and noncomplicated. I bought this laptop in Sep 2017 through Amazon. Today, just over two years the thing is dead and Apple Support says pay Rs.50,000.00 to change the motherboard. I bought it for Rs.60,000.00.  No guesses for anyone whothinks whether it is worth repairing. The propriety thing with Apple just goes a little too much. I did contactApple support asking them to reconsider their warranty terms.They said ""just too bad"" or word to that effect. I am now reconsidering buying any of their products. Just too bad.... So there you are. anyone thinking of buying apple products keep in mind the huge costs.... not to forget the likely short life of ""great Products"". O"
34,1.0 stars,  Do not go after brand. You can get pretty good configuration in this price. My MacBook is dead after 1 year when I kept it in cupboard for 2 weeks without use. Don't know how much I have to spend now ..
35,5.0 stars,"  Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  ¬†There is nothing to dislike about this machine. I'm sold by her looks, sleek and grace. It is not user friendly specially because i've had my hands on the black laptops forever but i'm getting around. I purchased Apple MacBook last year in December and it's been a pretty awesome experience. I love the MacOS applications. The keyboard is a delight to work in the dark. I have no issues with the sound quality! As a single user machine ,she never disappoints. Battery life is as mentioned. But to be very honest , I bought this machine because it adds to my collection of awesome gadgets. And I bought it because I could, I am so grateful! I love Apple products. They make for good show off, they look unique and stand out. This machine has been one of my best investments and technology acquired. So proud of her."
36,5.0 stars,"  The sheer fluidic response on this machine is simply awesome. Totally worth every penny.Even though I use Windows in my office for programming but this machine is a beast when it comes to performance. Zero lag, super fast reboot. Got it at a good deal for 47k."
37,4.0 stars,"  Amazing product,best for high computational work and programming."
38,5.0 stars,  excellent product with good exchange price... I like product and service
39,1.0 stars,"  Very disappointed by the product quality. After carefully using for 2 years my device stared giving me problem. As soon as welcome screen appears and I key in my credentials screen turns to green and lines all over it.  When I contacted Icare they charged 1990 rs as diagnosis charge and after diagnosis, they sent me mail that ""Checked and Found device is not powering on. Did SMC, PRAM and checked with known good power adapter - Still same issue, Checked internal condition - found liquid damage and corrosion marks on logic board. Hence Logic board need to replace the logic board under exchange price to check further. customer denied service .""  and overall repair charge was 48950 rs. Which is more than the cost of the laptop (44k when I purchased it.) and battery charge 12k separately"
40,1.0 stars,  Writing the review after a two yr usage of macbook. Bought it because of very good experience with other apple product. But this was pathetic. Within a year of use the screen had vertical colorful lines. Luckily it was under warranty and got it mended.Exactly after another yr i faced the same issue and cost of repair is only 42k.Very disappointed and people shld be aware of this issue before purchasing.Would not recommend to anyone.
41,1.0 stars,"  Don't buy for the pride or quality advertised. The lapot keyboard failed just 2 days after the warrenty period. Service cost was 19,000. So I backed out and was using a USB keyboard. Now the whole system is not switching On. Took to local service center it has costed me 3,500 to just make it work again and still will cost more to make the keyboard replaced. Truly gutted. I have my HP laptop pro book almost 9 years old still running without any issues. Was planning to buy an IPhone but surely not after this. Deeply sad by the experience."
42,5.0 stars,"  I purchased this for my mother, she is a prolific writer / poet and spends a ton of time on computers these days as a result. She has had fairly bad experiences with build quality, frequent hardware issues with other brands in the past and so wanted a good sturdy sleak laptop, this was a perfect  fit for her, especially now that the price was reasonably low and discounted, it was a no-brainer."
43,4.0 stars,"  well I have been using a windows laptop in the premium category for quiet some time.most of my time was spent dealing with driver issues with oem manufacturers, colossal problem with heating, os stutter in a 16 gb ram machine.i decide the pros and cons and again switched back to MacBook Air .1)the trackpad works like a dream.not like horrible windows with lag and stutter.multi gesture is a dream2) admittedly the display is not hd.but trust me much better than the much touted hd displays of horrific windows laptops I have used.in the same price range3)I am not a video editor but I am sure high end editing on 4k etc will be a challenge.but routine like image editing etc will be not an issue.if vfx pro etc is your daily grime look the Mac book pro4)routine work is a breeze..like..so cool the intuitive..experience...more so if you are in to the experience of apple ecosystem..airdrop etc...is very easy to comprehend5)the built quality and the battery is simply superb.here the low res display helps in easily 10-11 hours of usage.and 2 weeks of standby6)it is lighter and slimmer even than the new MacBook Air.7)no other MacBook has the glowing apple logo if it means much to you.maybe a collectible later:-)8)daily tasks are a breeze..however high end gaming will take a hit..tip:try and go for the extended warranty...at an apple store/apple protection plan"
44,1.0 stars,"  I brought this mac air on sep 2017. From past 1 week I am not able to turn on my mac, went to apple store and after troubleshooting they said it is having motherboard problem and need to replace which cost 50k, I was shocked and said how come in less than 2 year mac will have this issue. So kindly please beawre on this big bug mac air."
45,4.0 stars,"  Pros:Build: Metal material so still looks modern and rich.LightweightExcellent battery life (around 8-9hrs)Backlit keyboard(although all macbooks have it)OS. (Smooth Lagfree)Apple icloud storage: 1$/75Rs. a Month for 50GB of cloud storage.( Not an advantage but You will need this if you typically store photos, videos)Keyboard: excellant keyboard with haptic feedback keys.Cons:Display: 720p display. But its still pretty cool!Processor is bit old but it still runs efficiently.Storage: 128GB SSD will only leave you with 85GB of free space.( I suggest you invest 75Rs/Month and get extra 50GB icloud storage which works seamlessly)"
46,1.0 stars,"  After using almost 6 months I am sharing my review, I suggest to not buy this at all because after purchase within 10 days it's gave me shock while charging, after many followups finally they replaced with new laptop, I am quite happy that time but again same issue after 1 month, within 6 months I went to service center 2 times, Again I need to go 3rd time, That keys not work properly after some days and battery also not great, And worst gaming experience because its provide too much heat, We can't even use 30 min, Worst experience with Apple and work experience with amazon agents No one give customer satisfaction after purchasing"
47,1.0 stars,  It did not run properly for even a week...it is on service centre from 20 days
48,5.0 stars,"  I have been a Macbook pro user for last 2 years. I came across the new Macbook air and got a chance to put hands on it. So here is a brief review on my first impressions. Basically i will be comparing this with a regular laptop of similar price range and Macbook PROAir benefits compared to Non Apple laptop:# Slim and light weight for daily travel# 10-11 hours battery backup on normal usage# Apple touch pads are awesome, smooth and responsive compared to any premium laptop# Audio quality on speakers is good, but not as loud as my Macbook Pro 13# Apple front camera works the best in low light, best for low light skype calls# SSD - Apps launch very fast despite the low power processor# Metal body construction# Mag safe charger- If you are really careless this helps very much.# Ambient light sensor that adjusts brightness automatically ( Many people are not aware of this feature)# Keep your Air closed or leave somewhere idle and check back after 2 or 3 days, you will see battery has dropped less than 3 or 4 %# The best part - Mac OS, contains all that you need, a neat calendar, Todos app, notes, Quicktime, Mail app etc. Hassle free OSAir demerits compared to Non Apple laptop:Air demerits compared to Non Apple laptop:# Performance is on lower side# Good for basic usage only, internet, movies, video calls, spreadsheets, mail# You will get better display(Full HD) if you buy a 999$ Ultrabook from US (In India they come at premium)Should you consider Macbook PRO? - PRO advantagesI know a lot of people might be confused whether to go with PRO for some additional bucks. So listing benefits of pro from my experience"
49,1.0 stars,"  Not satisfied, purchased on Mar 2018, it was working well, now getting off suddenly  , went to apple service center but they are asking 45-50k and stating that it's motherboard problem.  Who will pay this much for repair, pls guide"
50,5.0 stars,"  I got this for 52K during Amazon Sale. I can say that this is the best budget friendly Macbook ever.I have been a windows user for a very long time and always wanted to try a Mac because the whole world uses it. I used to be an Apple critic. But after using it for months, I can say that I am never going back to Windows again.The only thing Windows does better is gaming. Buy a Windows if you care about gaming. For everything else, Mac should be your preference. If you are looking forward to developing iOS or Mac apps, Mac is the only way.It is much more faster, responsive and sturdy than my Windows laptop. The OS never crashes and the performance is just flawless. Meanwhile my Windows laptop crashes very often ( Blue screen of death, Unwanted updates, driver incompatibility etc). I receive free OS updates every now and then and there has never been a compatibility issue.Apple - You just earned a new customer for life. Just make sure you don‚Äôt keep increasing the prices as it is the only con I can think of.TL;DR - If you want a laptop that is not going to irritate you every now and then and your budget is 50-60K. Wait for the sale and go for this Mac. But remember - This is not for gaming. For that, buy windows"
51,4.0 stars,"  Purchased in July2018. After 2 years of good usage, its working same as when I bought it (processor basically). LOVE the trackpad and the keys!Things that changed after 2 years are that it starts heating up near the charging point (even when I'm not charging and simply using it) sometimes (3/10 times). I searched and found out it happens due to dirt particles going inside and can be resolved by going to a store and ask them to fix or buy a set of screwdriver for this mac and clean it up yourself.Another problem is the adapter, now after 2 years it had started heating up A LOT (7/10 times). Sometimes you can't even touch it for more than 5 seconds, it gets that hot. So for that what I do is use charger with its extension, put the adapter on the floor to transfer the heat (lol). It works most of the times for me, sometimes it doesn't and I have to take the magsafe connector off the laptop every few minutes (if I'm using the laptop) .The MagSafe connector also gets very hot while charging but cools down in literally 4-5 seconds after disconnecting.Third problem I saw is with Charging wire (from near the MagSafe connector), it's started to turn yellow due to heat probably. I put of a cable protector 2 months ago and saw this 'development' happening after that only mostly.  I took that protector off now.Overall it's a very good machine.  My friend who has the same model replaced the battery after 3+ years usage and now his laptop is working perfectly fine. He doesn't face heating problems much as I do. So maybe my laptop got some defects.I haven't tried other laptops in this range except Lenovo Yoga which was BS. I remember struggling to find internet and bluetooth connectivity in windows laptop, in Mac everything is so smooth. It doesn't hang at all! And yes not to forget, it's lightweight!! I think this is one the best machines in this price range. Go for it."
52,4.0 stars,"  its been 2 years since I bought this and never has it ever crashed on me.it works seamlessly with my AirPods, and iPhone, keeps my iCloud photos unto date instantlythe battery life is off the charts. I've been using it regularly for financial modelling, python for finance, movies, Apple Music, and even mild gaming, it has never disappointed me.as a student, I've used a windows pc too, but honestly, those have never lasted me too long without repair.ive always had to either do an over haul, or install some antivirus, but never for this MacBook.during covid times, in fact it has over performed, I never knew id rely so much on video conferencing, and the camera in this thing, is worlds better than others I have used that may even have better specs.sure, apple can eventually scrap updates for it, but to be honest I don't think it will, I just upgraded it to the new macOS Catalina and it's even smoother than everthe most important thing is honestly the build. everyone says Macs are delicate, but that's a huge farce. I carry this thing around all over, to work, to college, on flights, because its so light I end up carrying it around much too often. but as compared to my windows laptops, this one barely has any wear and tear. off I take care of it, I make sure I don't rough handle it, but I did the same with my older laptops, however they always ended up with buff marks or scratches.not too sure if my review really helps, but this is more of a rant about how good this laptop has been to me, and how much I rely on it.haha, cheers"
53,3.0 stars,"  I wanted to purchase the product in no cost EMI as what was displayed, but due to amazon internal error I had to purchase it on one go, so bit unsatisfied with amazon. Rest the product was good."
54,1.0 stars,  My MacBook logic board dead with 8 months...apple replaced my logic board and fixed my laptop. But within a year the logic board is dead again and cost of repairing the same is 40k+Plz don't buy it if you cannot afford to repair the same. Not sure what to do with my MacBook Air....it cost more to repair than a decent windows laptop.I will never buy any apple product in future...the cost to repair are extremely very high..
55,2.0 stars,"  I was a big Fan of Apple products and have been using the same for past 8 years. However the recent incident with my Mac Air that I brought through Amazon last October changes the perception towards Apple took a deep dent.Few months ago I had some issue with my MacAir screen, there was no accidental fall or mishandling on my part, which is quite evident as there are no physical damage not even a scratch which says that there was any mishandling on my part.At the time it was still under warranty period, So I took it to one of the Authorized apple store nearby, At the service centre the technician just by looking at the screen told me that it won‚Äôt be covered under warranty and I‚Äôve to pay  Rs. 43,000/- towards replacement, which came as a shock to me as, first there was no fault of my own, and secondly the whole thing cost me Rs. 54,000/- so I don‚Äôt know how Apple justify such unfair pricing. Thereafter, shocked and helpless I follow up with Apple Support repeated calls and chatting but all in vain, but apparently I found out that there is nothing on their hand, whatever the Authorized Apple Service center says is the final. I was told it is pressure damage, which won‚Äôt be covered under warranty and will cost me as much the cost of Original Machine. I was unaware and shock to find that Organization like Apple will indulge in such fraudulent and unfair trade practice for unfair monetary gain.When I look for more information online it came to my knowledge that this is not an uncommon thing with MacAir, it so fragile that MacAir is prone to pressure damage, a designing and manufacturing flaw, and there are many users who has suffered the same, and Apple has refused to address.Currently my Mac is unusable and just like that without any fault of my own my entire saving of Rs 54,000/- gone to waste. There is no question of repairing at an unjustified cost when few thousands more will get me a new one and there are better options avalible other than Mac .Pro: Atheistic, premium feelingCons: Shocking replacement cost,  Poor Post sale Support, Fragile and prone to screen damage"
56,1.0 stars,"  I bought this at end of November 2019.It worked good for 7 months till June 2020 and then screen started blinking.I went to Apple store for repair. They took 3 weeks to repair it. They repaired screen but battery life came to 3-4 hours which earlier was 10-11 hours and the usage was same. Also the fan sometimes automatically started running very fast and automatically stopped. Even switching ON after shut down, the fan started to run fast.When I brought back after repair, the charger got damaged after 4 days and I took MacBook as well as charger for repair. They exchanged the charger with the new one which doesn't look like Apple original, as when I plug in the charger, I get small amount of current over my MacBook.And they inspected MacBook and did something and said that Fan issue has been solved.After 1 week I'm still getting same Fan issues and the battery life has literally fallen a lot as compared to before the repair.So there is one year warranty for this, and I spent 3 months of it only in repair. And the problems started arising after 1st screen repair.It seems they knowingly put these so that you have to buy 2 year extra warranty.Everything started only after when I took my MacBook to repair."
57,5.0 stars,"  I newly switched to Mac OS and this MacBook Air 13"" model is best for those who are thinking to move from Windows to Mac OS, Good Battery Life, Comfortable, Very Slim. Apple MacBook Air provides much more features than the ordinary windows Laptop. Working on MacBook is very easy and lots of your time and efforts are reduced. I will not recommend MacBook for Gaming because this Device is meant for Professional Work.Purchasing an external hard disk would be the best option for those who has complaint about 128GB HDD."
58,5.0 stars,"  I purchased this mac 2 years back during sale and I absolutely love it. I was on Team Windows for many many years and have used HP, lenovo, Dell and Acer laptops in the past. I was told multiple tales about the difficulties of using a mac interface after being a windows user. Please do not be disuaded by all this and give it a try. I barely takes a week to get accustomed to everything.PROS:1. This is the best for daily/work use due to its battery life. It works seamlessly for over 12 to 15hours without plugging in a wall charger2. The laptop is seriously light weight which makes it easy to use on the go3. Gets all new software updates released by apple4. The windows based laptops from the companies mentioned above start ageing but 1.5year mark. Slower speed, diminishing battery life, hardware and software issues. None of the usual crap is seen with a mac. My 2 year old mac has the same functionality like the day of its purchase.5. Good for video editing6. Keyboard is great7. Best mouse tracker overallCONS:1. Apple laptops are expensive so I recommend waiting for sale to purchase one. It is also an investment for next 5 to 6 years for seamless laptop use. Buy only if you are going to get a good use out of it.2. The screen quality of this model( aka older version) is not the best. Newer models have a significantly better display. If you have the money, go for it.3. This is not a gaming laptop. If you are looking for that, this is not for you.Overall impression:I dont think a mac should be purchased to be a status symbol or by brand fanatics.If you are a student or someone who requires a mid range laptop, I would recommend this.For people with bigger pockets, I would recommend the new macbook air. The screen quality is excellent and the laptop is much faster than its contemporaries."
59,2.0 stars,"  bought in oct 2018 and it broke down in 7 jan 2018 ..and tell you what ..afte spending that much money on worlds best considered brand you got your machine completly down not even powering on you must realise that money can not buy peace machine is machine after allpositives: 1. very portable 2. fast os 3. has wow factor 4. very good battery life 5. sturdy negetives: 1. average after sale customer service, it is now 15th day and my MBA is still with service centre and status repair going on 2. memory upgrade very costly 3. MS windows shifters will have tough time to adjust to new scheme of things 4. third party softwares will cost more than what they do in windows"
60,1.0 stars,"  Stopped working after 1 year and 2 months, just died for no reason.What the hell, such horrible customer support. Straightaway charging 3.5 K for diagnosis and 43 K for motherboard replacement that too for a fault that is on their end (their hardware).Feels like the most illogical thing I have ever faced. Hugely disappointed in Apple.Product is amazing as long as you don't face such issue. however, if you try to search videos on youtube youtube, you will see tens of thousands of views on videos related sudden death of Macbook air, which proves that this is a very common problem and seems like Apple customer support has only one  solution for all their hardware problems, replace the motherboard. What the hell!!! How are we expected to trust Apple products?"
61,5.0 stars,"  I was very confused on buying Mac Air over other Gaming laptops which offered better specs. But somehow it made sense over the time. I am writing this review after 1 year of usage. I bought the Mac Air (2017 version) on Jan 2019 for around 61K.Experience:About 121 GB will be available for your usage. System is super speed and responsive. Absolutely seamless performance. Display is a beauty. I know some would complain about its viewing angle, but when you start to use it, no one will care about such technical details. Its the most lightest and slimmest machine, don't worry weight. The best part is, Battery Backup. Its so long that you'll even forget when was it last charged. Even on straight usage, minimum 8 hours is guaranteed. I think its more than that.If you are a software developer, trust me, it will perform way more than any other i5+8GB machine, plus you get the Linux flavor.But.......1) Don't buy if you are gamer. Please don't buy. This is not meant for that.2) Don't buy if you are a big fan of windows and use too many 'unpopular' software. Although Mac OS will support all enterprise level and popular software, you will not find software for every crappy thing.3) If you are a careless user of laptop, like smashing keyboard and dropping laptop kinda guy/girl. Mac is somewhat sensitive and cannot withstand your strong emotional outbursts.4) Don't buy if you need a dedicated Graphics card or high performance systems. Like for Data Analysis, Machine Learning (Basic stuffs can be done though), computational chemistry or too heavy stuff like that.My advice:More than the specs, Seek a machine that seeks you."
62,1.0 stars,"  Be careful while buying electronic products through Amazon.I bought this macbook for 56k on March 2018. After 1.5 years of usage, the display stopped working for no reason. The device never had any accidental drop or shock while I was using it through these years. The service center guy told me it would cost around 41k for screen replacement. Now I'm left with no option.If you are buying, I suggest you to buy it along with a protection plan or any extended warranty."
63,1.0 stars,  charger not workingservice center not available to replace charger
64,1.0 stars,"  I have been a Mac user for more than a decade now and a Mac Book Air user for about 6 years in that time. Deeply disappointed in this purchase. The camera does not function. Unfortunately for me, I did not use camera for all these months (I am more of a zoom/skype from my phone person) and realized this glitch only about a month back. Have already spoken with Customer Care at Apple and they have also confirmed that my camera indeed does not work and advised me to take the laptop to local apple store. That surely isn't happening now owing to the lockdown that we are all currently in."
65,1.0 stars,"  works for 1 year and then one fine day doesn't turn on! Hopes intact I rush to a service centre and thanks to the awesome business strategy.  Motherboard gone battery's gone. 56000 laptop now requires 52000 to be repaired.  Hope shattered, take to a private shop and spend 18000. Guess wat, my laptop finally wakes up to go to sleep again after 2 days."
66,5.0 stars,"  Cons :low storagedoes not open windows softwares.Difficult to connect with android phones without appHas butterfly key board which doesn't feel too great.not ideal for gamingStarts making noise after long heavy usage.Magnetic charger heats up drastically if plugged in and work simultaneously.But this is only on very heavy usage.Repairing beyond warranty period will cost you a fortunepros:battery last 10 hours with moderate usagebrilliant for browsing, media (a brilliant display), reading ,simple codingMac os is extremely convenient (ex:work space ,three finger swipe , pinch gestures etc.Trackpad feels amazing,making presentation with key note feels wonderful )Get regular updates for the os."
67,5.0 stars,"  I am a Music producer and I am writing this review after 2 years of usage of my MacBook Air 13 inches. When I received the Laptop, I had to face a few software issues but when I updated my Operating system, those issues got fixed. It would be a greater laptop for those who knows what it does. Apple is not for everyone and not for simple use. If you know what you are doing and know what you want, then MacBook Air is a best Laptop. It is way faster than my desktop at home that has 3.0GHz of processing speed whereas my Laptop offers only 1.8 GHz processing speed. This is a positive review and Music producers out there, I would highly recommend this Laptop for you that is of low price and amazing process."
68,5.0 stars,"  After using Windows Operating system for the past 10+ years, I switched to Mac. The switch was inspired by the awesome reviews I got from my friends. I must say that they were all real and that the device and the tech is so very impressive. Be it the design,  be it the processing speed, be it the battery life......all are way ahead than that of a Windows device. I am satisfied to get the marvel of a tech in my hands. It is saving my time every now and then as I am stricken with an idea to pen a couplet, short story or poem.....I simply open the lid, note the idea and then simply close it....no need of shutting the OS down everytime. Working perfectly."
69,1.0 stars,"  After two years of buying this dream, it became a nightmare when it just refused to power on. Took it to a service centre and I was told they had to replace the mother board for Rsm 46,000. Reading the reviews, I realize there are a whole lot of people who have faced the same problem like me. It is evident that defective pieces are being sold online. No more Mac priducts for me. I have learnt my lesson. However, if you still feel you must buy this product, please don't buy it online but pay it from a store."
70,5.0 stars,"  Pros -1) Looks  Splendid and amazing.2) Genuine Apple product and so light .3) Extremely Fast , can multi task.4) Above average battery / just shut the lid and open it anytime ( it will not buffer )5) if you have an I phone  , you can connect it and life is simpler and can sync everything.6) Go for it if you want to browse , watch videos and best if you are lazy/laid back as the Mac book air opens so quick and you can continue from where you left or if you wish to search something and would like to see an answer asap rather than waiting for your windows to open and buffer etc etc and lose interest ( been there done that :) )Cons1) storage is very less ( 128 gb)2) mostly for browsing and can do Usual ppt/excel office work .3) Big no for gaming and for heavy editing4) 2017 model"
71,5.0 stars,"  Honestly, there's nothing like a Mac. It works so fast and so smooth.My work requires multiple windows each containing 20-40 tabs open at a time.Not once has it slowed down or lagged.I work really fast and keep switching tabs and apps and I have no issues.If you're working from home, this is definitely worth it. You don't have to wait for things to load.I've been using Mac since 2015 and I can't go back. I bought this one in Dec 2019 at Rs. 57000. Totally worth it."
72,1.0 stars,  This seems to be a common problem for the MacBook sold by Amazon. Bought my MacBook Air from Amazon in Mar of 2019. Mac completely stopped working after a year and a half. Authorised service centre says Logic board is the problem and Apple recommends a the complete logic board to be replaced which costs Rs 35000/-. How illogical is that when Amazon is selling the MacBook Air at Rs.65000/-. The question is if Amazon is cheating us in India?
73,1.0 stars,"  I bought it with very high expectation, but its logic board got damaged in 1.5 years only. The repalcement charges for logic board is around 40500INR. I am very dissappointed with the product and I am switching back to windows."
74,4.0 stars,"  This MacBook is low on price and very nice to use. First of all, it's apple and the product is excellent. I have been an apple user bit never used a MacBook before. The quality is 1st class but in case of display if you look closely you can see pixels but not big of and issue. It is working nicely and fast but one thing is clear... *IT IS NOT FOR GAMING* games will lag but you can still play apple arcade or play games from browser... A thing is apps like netflix and ms teams, Pinterest, Spotify etc. U can not find in app store but you can get em from the web browser. Lemme tell u battery life is OUTSTANDING it litterally charges in 5 mins trust me and lasts long ‚úåÔ∏èüòãOverall I'll give it 4 stars for display and games but if you are thinking to buy it, go for it don't think twice ü§ó thank you for reading this and *GO FOR IT*"
75,1.0 stars,"  Amazon delivering defected products amazon made delay in delivery of appx. 4days even after continue follow ups CC, they guys are also trained in giving fake/wrong information. After that it stop working automatically i visited Apple Store three time within 2 weeks of purchase it still not working properly. Even on twitter apple is not responding buying apple products is just wastage of money. Amazon n Apple this time made a best combination cause they proved these both are worst."
76,5.0 stars,  Defective keyboard. Manufacturing defect. Had to return.Update:For it replaced. New product. Working very well.
77,2.0 stars,"  The product is what it is you can refer to tons of websites which are much better for seeing laptop reviews and relevant as well. i would only refer to my amazon experience for this product. even after 5 days of delivery the product purchase is not verified with apple yet, meaning, i am unable to get any support from apple on anything while setting things up in my new laptop.  I tried following up with Amazon through email, call, chat and what not and they are easy to get to deliver an expensive item but difficult to get hold of for any follow up post sale.i am still following up with them to register my purchase with apple and my overall review rating is purely for Amazon and not for Apple."
78,2.0 stars,"  Everything was fine until one fateful day, the laptop decided not to work! When I checked with Apple service centre, they are telling logic board to be replaced and it costs 45k! Since I did not purchase any additional warranty, neither I cannot repair this nor cannot leave just like thatSurprisingly the fault happened after few months of 1year warranty with no sign of faulty behavior until that last day!If you are Apple Fan buy with additional warranty else buy some other laptop"
79,1.0 stars,"  One of the worst product i have ever bought. The screen will get fade out after the end of the product warranty. You wouldn't have any option rather taking the laptop to service center. You would have to bear a huge cost for that.. around 15k to 25+k.. which means you need to buy a brand new laptop.In one word, ""Waste of Money""."
80,1.0 stars,  Worst Laptop in the history of Mankind. Its has a scam software which makes it dead and when it reaches the recycler it becomes active after software rewriting. It is a SCAM by APPLE. Earlier cases have been reported in USA and apple have lost many cases in this regard. Overall Apple is FRAUD.
81,5.0 stars,"  Bought this during Diwali sale. Apple is amazing. I was confused between Dell/HP touchscreen laptops and Macbook. Then after going through every single detail, I must say this is very powerful machine. If you dont require so much softwares , then definitely go for it. Being a researcher and student, whatever i need is easily available through softonic or other websites. and it has good substitute of MS Office. Battery Back up is very good. I use it for 7-8 hours a day and normally it can be used for upto 15 hours."
82,1.0 stars,  This is the worst  apple product I have ever seen ...6 month After purchase of this fake book ...some of its keys of keyboard  stopped working ...So the service center  replace my keyboard with the new one ...But after some months with  the new replaced  keyboard some of its key again stopped working .All these things happen in one year and 3 month timeline which is roughly 1.5 years of original purchase date ... ...When I spoke to the service center they told me that the warranty is over you need to pay 12000 rs ...So I don't have any option. The cost is too high. ..So now I m working with the external keyboard which cost me merely 200 rs ... My friend bought the same macbook from the showroom and i must say its really working good and it doesnt show any fault at all .Till now .i wish i also bought this macbook from the showroom ....
83,2.0 stars,"  Very handy laptop, light weight and portable. Mac OS is super cool. Battery backup was good. Defective product recieved,within 2 months of use, laptop gets switched off suddenly while on battery. Requires power input to restart again.Contacted service centre, they told its motherboard problem and replaced motherboard under warranty, but problem still persisting. Laptop still at service center. Earlier i was using toshiba laptop, satellite 340,lasted 8 yrs without any problem. Paid a premium for macbook air very dissapointed with apple quality of products. And to repair it outside warranty, parts cost as much as the laptop itselfüôÑ"
84,1.0 stars,  Well the product's logic board is dead in less than 2 year. I am a regular user and only use it for routine office work. So much of apple quality.
85,5.0 stars,"  Battery life ~ not goodGaming~ worstScreen quality~ average , it's been 2 year the screen has gone.Worst laptop you can buy under ~50000Go for Asus laptop they are better and more durable."
86,5.0 stars,"  I was looking for an affordable long lasting light laptop and my search led me to this. I know Apple has launch a new Air but this is still a good performer and with the recent price cut this laptop makes so much sense. I was using MacBook Pro for last 8 years, and after it retired this replaced the Pro and is not doing a bad job at it at all."
87,5.0 stars,"  MacBook Air is excellent. The build is super strong, the operating systems runs smooth. The trackpad and keyboard are great. The only thing that can be improved is its screen (the visuals). Not as good as expected. The hard disk is too small but if you carry an external hard disk you can solve that problem. Got it at the price of a Dell Windows laptop during Amazon sale. A great deal."
88,1.0 stars,"  I shall never recommend To buy expensive Mac air laptops or Mac book on line. Just after one month of purchase, the screen disappeared. Not even switching on. It looks like the Delhi retailer played with it, disposing off a old model with defective piece. This fault should have happened in 15 days but happened after 30 days. So much disappointment beyond imagination."
89,1.0 stars,"  The macbook received has a faulty keyboard. The keys are taking wrong input. eg: on pressing @, the macbook is receiving "" as input. It's really irritating as there is no option to return or replace the product via Amazon. Please help ASAP. Its an expensive purchase and there is no support from Amazons end."
90,1.0 stars,"  General observation, Do not buy expensive electronics from Amazon as thy have no quality control in place/checks on their vendors. Mostly, vendors pass on defective items to customers. It is true across categories."
91,5.0 stars,"  I was apprehensive of buying Apple product from Amazon as some reviews suggested that imported items are being sold. However what I got was fresh and genuine product, I checked warranty on Apple site with serial no. All serial no - on bill, box, inner box and in macOS itself were consistent. Display is too good and it feels like butter operating the device. Only thing is that price difference between this and 256GB version is too much."
92,3.0 stars,  Good Performance. Though it heats up often despite all Software Updates.
93,1.0 stars,"  Display and motherboard defective. Had a horrible time, tried applying for replacement. Couldn‚Äôt get it because amazon has a 7 day replacement warranty that I had missed. Please be careful when buying this machine. Make sure you check it thoroughly immediately and file a report even if you find a small issue. Screen flickering could be motherboard/display issue or both.Won‚Äôt recommend this laptop. And unfortunately I am stuck with it."
94,5.0 stars,"  The MacBook is good in-terms of what it is designed for. The laptop is light weight so no hassle while carrying during travels. The backlit keyboard is a good advantage to work in low light. The performance is good, I use it for game development and I have not faced any problems until now. The transition from Windows to Mac was easy, not much of a hassle, initial few days, to understand the shortcut keys and how to operate will be little bit slow, post that it is just a breeze.

It would turn was trying to restart automatically. I then reoaired it from apple care. It again got dead and woulnt turn onn. I put all the money into water. I dont know what to do with this."
97,1.0 stars,  First Time Worst experience with an apple product....I bought a Mac book air...new product not getting switched on!did all troubleshooting guided by technical team from Amazon and Apple!what a quality test from Apple?! Primium product with primium price!!!!!!!In future I should think twice before buying!
98,1.0 stars,"  Disappointed as the MacBook came with a scratch , non laminated box, no sticker on the full body of the macbook and a scratch!!Moreover the charger refused to charge. Looks like a used item being sent. Even the instruction manuals were crumpled.Didn't feel like a new MacBook. Couldn't charge as the charger refused to turn on and charge.Now Amazon doesn't have an option for replacement! So returning üò°üò°"
99,1.0 stars,"  Ordered an Apple Mac Book Air. Utterly disappointed when we tried to set it up . The keys wouldn‚Äôt work. To say that it was shocking would not be further from the truth because when you order a high end product like this you don‚Äôt expect a defective piece which has scratches on it. While we wanted a refund, that was denied and a new piece was sent. For now it‚Äôs working fine but there‚Äôs always a doubt now. Really disappointed and let down by Amazon.."
100,2.0 stars,"  I bought two pieces of this , because I really heard good comments about it but unfortunately just after the 2nd year both of them have faced problems, one faced mother board problem and another one screen problem. I am sorry but if your looking for long lasting laptops then don‚Äôt buy this model. It‚Äôs waste of money. This model of Apple is not good at all."
101,3.0 stars,"  Everything about this product seems to be fine as of now. Got an option to upgrade to higher OS and install tools required for my work. Except for not so good sound quality while watching movies through itunes stores, other aspect seems to be fine. Higher storage options (256 GB) may be required for power users who may want to app development on this system. Current configuration suits light - medium heavy user(I belong to this category)- (need xcode debugging feature for my projects )."
102,5.0 stars,"  It's the best investment I have made. I would have regret if would have bought a windows laptop instead. You have to just compromise with the screen quality. But what else you get worths buying this. Best performance in this price, best battery life in any laptop in this price range or this may be better than other expensive windows laptops, you get the best build quality and a reliable and secure OS i.e macOS. Guys, if you can afford this, please ignore windows laptop, only if you can compromise with screen quality. You may get better screen quality in the cheapest windows laptops, but everything else, won't be worth compromising. I bet you..Get it today..!"
103,3.0 stars,  There is a saying in our language which tells us everything degrades over time but I did not expect this to be true for an apple laptop of less than a year. My battery life which used to be around 12 hours when I bought this thing is now down to about 6And I watch less movies now and use more apps like word or Internet now than I did back then. I don't even play games on this!!!!
104,1.0 stars,  My macbook air which I ordered on amazon through appario retails started having trouble 2 months after the purchase. Service center people told me that it's logic board was defective. Also is warranty was not updated by amazon. Serial number of the order was blurred on the invoice copy which I got with the device. There was no option of online device on the app. I had a lot of trouble updating its warranty with apple. There is no option of any feedback or how to contact amazon that's why I am writing here. I am not going to purchase any electronic item on amazon again as I have had a terrible experience. I also request other ppl to do the same
105,3.0 stars,"  Having used this MacBook Air for almost one week, I wish to say this is a value for money(I paid INR 57,000) for those who are wanting for a MacBook for general use. The highlights are its compact size, above average computing performance, longer battery backup. The drawback is a significantly low on display resolution. I was sadly disappointed knowing this after product was delivered. Having used a MacBook Pro for more than 2 years with a higher resolution display, I'm not able to digest using a below average resolution laptop. If the display resolution is one of your three major requirements of a laptop go for a MacBook Pro or another brand."
106,4.0 stars,"  writing this review after using 1year of laptop, geniune review, never any complaint about batterylife it is awesome. just a problem is with for engineering background student or any heavy laptop user for editing work and all, generally most of the applications can be downloaded online from google, but heavy apps like solidwork and video editing is quite difficult in this laptop. autocad can be run easily , main problem arise when you learn online in which mostly youtube videos are based on windows operating sysytem. maorever its a brand it will give you different look than other ."
107,4.0 stars,  This product claims to come preinstalled with OSX Sierra but instead comes with Catalina.Please update that in your description.I purchased the product only because i wanted OSX Sierra and got disappointed with Catalina.
108,5.0 stars,  I am in love with my MacBook. Its smart. It never hangs. Its fast. Sound quality is commendable. The picture quality is just fabulous. Its worth money and time. I can run any programs in it. It has sofisticated software that can compile any language programs.
109,5.0 stars,"  Writing review after using it for 3 weeks1. Charged it twice....And it would not charge 3rd time- but surprisingly the battery lasted 10 hours and I could finish my important presentation. 10/102.The customer care told that charging port had issue  - and what a pleasant  surprise they changed whole motherboard for free Excellent customer care 10/103. Touch pad had an issue but again it surprised me-- the immediate next day it came back.. wowTheir application at customer care is so good. Don't even have to stand in que.. booking appointments is so easy... And service centre was also very good. Had plenty of comfortable seats. Drinking water facility too. Customer care right in the heart of city and it was air conditioned.Will update reviews about laptop once I get to use it...A very Good company, Go for it... :)"

112,1.0 stars,  The screen has been flickering badly since the day I received it. I have been trying to get in touch with the retailer but no luck yet. The process is made difficult deliberately to delay the return. Highly disappointed.
113,5.0 stars,"  Its said once an Apple user is always an apple user. I was using MAC Book Pro early 2012 and now i went for this one. Superb battery life and light weight. Being a corporate user I don't have requirement of gaming etc. Well, Storage could be a problem if you wish to keep bulk files. Else just go for it.  post installing MS office suite etc i am left with around 50GB, which i am comfortable with . If required I use my 1.5 TB external disk."
114,1.0 stars,  The worst laptop I have ever seen except battery. I thought of Apple laptops are useful after 1 year as it is a biggest brand name in world. But i regret of it i will never recommend apple laptop in future.
115,1.0 stars,  Laptop is awesome and very smooth but If you are buying this laptop make sure to extend the warranty otherwise it will be waste of your money after few years. Repairing charges is almost same as the price of laptop in Apple care. the usual issue you will face is that it goes shut down automatically after using of few years and if your laptop warranty has expired then you have to pay 43k-45k for replacing the parts. If you are enough rich to buy new laptop after each and every 3-4 years then you can go for it.
116,1.0 stars,"  I was excited, because this was my first Apple product. But unfortunately got a worse than a refurbished Mac book, as I got this product on 27th Dec 2019 and till date ( Jan 1st 2020 ) I'm unable to use because it has stuck on welcome page and tried all possible ways and watched multiple videos to get over the welcome page but since 7 days got no help from Amazon team too. Never purchase any product through online"
117,2.0 stars,  The MacBook Air is not covered under the 1 year warranty that it is supposed to come with. Have tried activating the same using the product serial number and the purchase date on the apple website - but it is not accepting the same. Kindly let me know what needs to be done.
118,4.0 stars,  Apple product doesn't need any introduction in terms of quality . Great deals on Amazon convince me to purchase macbook air. Genuine product verified from Apple site and packaging was great.Pro: 1. Very sleek design  2. Backlit keyboard  3. Intel i5 processor and 8GB ram nakes this  laptop ideal for professional as well student.4. Sound and screen quality is great5. Premium touchCon: 1. Very less Hard drive space  2. This price range lot of better option available

120,4.0 stars,  - NO lags !!- Good Battery life !!- Fit for regular office works !!- Storage is 128 GB - Up grade costs more !!- Screen Quality is mediocre !!- Apple Mac Os is smooth but updates / App installations out of home country become buggy due to apple id Error !!- Expensive

122,1.0 stars,"  The product was dead in just one and half years. Apple service is great experience but they charged Rs 2600 for checking the machine and asked another fifty-five thousand rupees for replacing the battery and board which was found to have ""issues"". Now the MacBook is with my kidsüò¨"
123,5.0 stars,"  Couldn't have received a better laptop. Look Macs aren't for gaming.  So don't expect good gameplay. but if you really wanna get a performance, it will have it for you with a little heating.it surfs like a beast. if you do casual stuff like browsing or typing, you will be surprised. the fans rarely kick in.The battery is a bomb! Provides service all around the day with medium brightness. takes around 2-3 hrs to charge and man the safe charging system rocks. you will never tip off the mac.Editing is managed like a magical spell. no issue at all. BUT DON'T EXPECT IT TO SERVE LIKE A MACBOOK PRO, IT'S AIR.in terms of style, man it will rock you. Trust me, You won't regret."
124,5.0 stars,"  The macbook air, 2017 model is an excellent choice if you want a protable laptop with best battery life for office purpose.It's still worth investigating in this machine. (my opinion, based on my experience).Disclaimer: keeping in mind it's not a good fit for graphic designers and gamers.Feedback on customer service:unfortunately I got a damaged laptop (one key is coming out) .I have placed request for replacement.The process of putting a replacement request can be more customer friendly."
125,4.0 stars,"  Awesome MacBook Air.. Didn't want to buy the newer retina versions, as they are very difficult to get repaired.. Got this one at a very good price (With Exchange).. Also genuine product.. Sr No showed online.. Warranty started the day of delivery.. Completely Satisfied.."
126,5.0 stars,  This is a workhorse ! Awesome 12 hours plus battery life and super intuitive laptop. Only thing I don't like is tiny memory ! 1TB would be more like it !
127,5.0 stars,"  Some people say Apple MacBook is highly priced. I would suggest them to compare the features other laptop offers.For example, consider the weight and battery life all other company has the almost equivalent price. Integration of softwares is beautiful. I bought this for my son who was a window users. He was doing some simulation-based programming. When windows laptop took to fins the simulation in 9 hours, MacBook took only 4 hours."
128,5.0 stars,"  Bought it in Feb 2020Recently few days back it's motherboard got down completely.If it's under warranty, then it's okay otherwise it costs 40000 rupees.So buying is fine but remember the cost of after sales, it's way higher and beyond affordable.So buy any mac product only if you have lots of money and wants to show off a small logonto others otherwise it's not a value for money at all."
129,5.0 stars,  It's still best to buy in 2019Design is out-standingBattery life can be one of the reasons to buy because it literally give more than 10 hours(with internet use)Its weight is just 1.2 kg..i mean its sooo..lightweightI dont think anyone can complane against this product..Ya price is a bit high..But focus at the product they r giving to u..its the best laptop i would recommend in this price range..(50k-58k)+This is not for gaming so plz dont make a mistake to buy it for gamingScreen quality is quite a bit low(only if u are habitual of using 4k screen)Track pad works at it's best..the gestures they provide u..the shortcut of keypad u can never get in any other windows laptop
130,5.0 stars,"  Amazing product..it has quality written all over it..great battery, easy to adapt if you are moving from windows..the trackpad, gestures, everything is so damm goodHad read many reviews about the display being bad...it is..if you are trying to look at atomic level details..its a fantastic screen with great audio output..Everything g screams quality and premium about the macbook..love it."
131,1.0 stars,"  I purchased this laptop from AMAZON in DEC 2019.  In AUG it stopped booting up.  I visited APPLE SERVICE CENTER with LAPTOP.  As per APPLE RECORDS,  this laptop was solve din MAY 2019.  They looked at invoice provided by AMAZON and found NO SERIAL NUMBER mentioned in invoice.  I complained by calling AMAZON and was asked to give them 6 days but till now no revert back from them.  Not sure if this is a FAKE PRODUCT or What."
132,1.0 stars,"  Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  ¬†After saving for 3 months, I bought this for ‚Çπ66,000 and Apple is the last company I can expect such bad quality from.From day one this has been hanging, even after updating, the numbers and excel were working super slow. I purchased excel subscription just for this, still it stops responding in between. While charging it gets super heat up, and one day out of the blue I started hearing the processor voice.It‚Äôs not just hampering my work, but after such expensive buy you don‚Äôt wish such things to happen, it‚Äôs been a nightmare since I‚Äôve bought this.It‚Äôs not even a month and upon contacting Amazon for replacement, they simply denied to help me. The only solution according to Amazon is to take it to Apple service centre. Even if I take a product which has been defective from the start to service centre, it‚Äôll still give me problem in the long run and hence I demanded replacement. I even asked for refund which they said no to.Big companies like Amazon and Apple makes a fool out of you when it comes to handling customer problems in the name of company policies.‚Çπ66k is not a small amount, and seeing their policies it makes me angrier that how they treat their customers.I don‚Äôt recommend buying this from Amazon."
133,1.0 stars,"  I did not do any heavy work on this apple MacBook air. I was doing mostly documentation. The system started having problem within the warranty period, the battery was draining fast. Also, after one year and three months, the MLB needs to be replaced which cost around INR 48700. So if you  have not bought the extended warranty it's just too bad. Overall a bad bad product."
134,1.0 stars,"  So after a year of using it, unfortunately the smc chip and memory synchronisation is at fault. There is no manual resetting that works and the only option is to get the chips replaced which costs around 19k. So much for long lasting. Though I must say it worked like a pro for 1 year and now its time to bury it."
135,5.0 stars,  For gaming a NOScreen quality not as it criticised it is very nice and clear even visible in sunlight brightness is good battery easily get 8 hrs with Editting .Finally satisfied with hardware and software bit tough  if u are a windows user. But 15 days of ise u will be ok with it. Worth pricing and O recommend in even 2020 used for 25 days  and reviewed . Good machine for editing videos . Happy with amazon services and apple good one
136,5.0 stars,"  The rating isn't for Apple's performance. I exchanged my old MacBook Air 11' (2013) for MacBook Air 13.3' (2017): and I haven't been disappointed. They both are fantastic machines, there isn't a bit of change except the screen - it is slightly bigger and better...The rating for the seller - I would give 5 star for delivery and 4 star for packaging. However, the product came with multiple scratches. I am unable to conclude whose fault it is- Apple or the reseller (in this case - Cloudtail India Pvt Ltd).I have restored my previous backup and will observe the performance over the week. If it under performs- I will report it to the authorities. If it performs well, the scratches may have been anyone's fault but can be ignored...I shall update this review in a week's time..."

138,1.0 stars,  Got defective product and Amazon is not ready to return/replace the laptop. It's battery is draining in 5 hours and screen quality is also too bad. Please go for other brands in cheaper price otherwise you may regret later that you could have gone for other options.
139,1.0 stars,  Purchased a Mac Book Air on 08/08/2019. It‚Äôs been 3just three months since I bought it and I am having issues with the keyboard. Took it to the authorised service center and was told that the keyboard has to be replaced. This is not the quality that I expect from any Apple product... utterly dissatisfied and disappointed with this purchase.
140,1.0 stars,  Worst laptop I've ever seen in my life. It's just an year of buying this from Amazon and now it is not turning on.Always handled with care but did not know this will happen. Very disappointed with Apple and its dealer. Pathetic.
141,1.0 stars,"  The key board has an issue. The dot key does not work and I have spent close to 2-3 hrs trying to solve the problem. The technical team is unqualified to solve any problem.Instead of replacing the piece they have made me run from pillar to post.I highly recommend not to  purchase of this product or any other electronic on amazon.Very bad service, there should be no questions asked, if a customer says he has a problem, the product should be replace.Very disappointed"
142,5.0 stars,"  I bought this laptop on the amazon indian festival sale. I got it at a much lower price on amazon as compared to the apple store (about 20k cheaper). Everything about the laptop is good; speed, screen quality, battery life etc.It was a total worth buy. Total recommend."
143,5.0 stars,"  After using windows laptops from almost 6 years I bought this machine. Initially it was hard to get used to the MacBook OS and it's features but trust me, after using it for a week you'll fall in love with MacBook.Pros:1. Sound Quality is really clear and good.2. Battery life is amazing, I use it daily for almost 2-4 hrs and I charge it only once in 2-3 days.3. Finger gestures are amazing.4. Speed ‚ù§Ô∏è. No lags whatsoever.Cons:1. Apple should have updated the 2017 MacBook with Retina display, although this display is works perfectly fine.2. To use some applications, you've to buy them. Can not use cracked version unlike windows.If you're looking for a laptop (non-gaming) within 50-60k budget which you want to use it for long term, buy this one."
144,5.0 stars,"  if you're not doing any hardcore processing work like coding, video editing. MacBook Air is best for the normal everyday life use.- very good battery life- amazing OS- nice sound and video quality- processor is old but it do the work for basic tasks and doesn't heat up.If its in your budget go for it you wouldn't regret it."
145,5.0 stars,  Value for money MacBook - Ideal for students - Gifted it to my son who is a iOS programmer apart from a student.His feedback has been good
146,5.0 stars,"  I preferred this over other good spec windows laptop, just for reason mac. 128 gb ssd was only concern as it may not be sufficient however adding external hd or flash drive will do the job for u. Overall even the screen is not full hd i did not find it much of the issue, however If u r concern about good display must for consider this as option. Additionaly over 13000 discount in last sale made this perfect deal."
147,5.0 stars,"  Pros: Great for work, outstanding battery life, rapid charge, keyboard is smooth, trackpad is smooth, built in 128GB SSD is worth it if you are looking for long term work performance. For 66k, I would really recommend the Air. I have installed Anaconda on it and seems there has been no issue with the background code processing so far. Sound quality is very nice, placement of the speakers really does the trick.Cons: Power adapter gets heated up very much. Would've preferred 8th or 10th Gen iCore, but I have no regrets. Will post if there are more cons to it. Let's see what more can this laptop do!"
148,1.0 stars,  i have used this product for almost two months and now slowly i am getting to know the defects it is having. i am facing problem in updating software and even the hinge is not holding the screen properly. i have not even dropped it once but problem are appearing slowly. very disappointing that amazon is sending such a defective product...
149,2.0 stars,"  I was excited and got this laptop, I am not heavy user hardly use 20-40 hours in a month, with in a year mother board got damage, at that time I was out of india and Apple store was close to my place and mother board got replaced in a day, again after a year it got shutdown when watching YouTube and not booting up, no it‚Äôs gone use less."
150,5.0 stars,"  Brilliant laptop for people who need a good laptop for professional use. Loved the look and feel of the product. Apple always makes sure to give that premium feel in every bit of it's products. Right from packaging to the product itself, everything is brilliant.This laptop is definitely not for gaming but for all other purpose this is the go-to product."
151,5.0 stars,"  If you want to go for a MacBook but don't have the budget for a pro or if your requirements are very basic like browsing, entertainment, and other normal tasks then just go for it. It is better than any other laptop at this price range. I am using it for the past two years but no issues whatsoever, a windows laptop would have given lots of issues by now."
152,3.0 stars,"  Being an Apple fan, I have no complaints about the product. I would like to keep this post w.r Amazon purchase experience and deliver standards.As always, Amazon shopping experience was amazing.Amazon delivered the product on time. That always makes me happy.I did find some minor scratches on the MacBook. That disappointed me a little.I think I was given a used piece."
153,4.0 stars,"  I have to take my laptop for servicing twice within my warranty period, one of the USB ports seems to a lil dodgy and had to be replaced.Then again, last month I had to change ,my logic board, so I'm suspecting I was handed a very old Mac which was probably forgotten in their warehouse."
154,1.0 stars,  From the very beginning the battery life was horrible . hardly 2 hours. And after using it for just a year it just stopped working . and i cannot even charge it. Terrible product sold by Amazon
155,5.0 stars,  Works perfect. Excellent for student to use for their school /  collage purpose. The speed is good graphics are good. Best is the weight which does not add anything to ur existing bag. Bought it for my kid during this lockdown and he is loving the experience.
156,4.0 stars,"  This Laptop is the best option for office work and other tasks like browsing watching movies and music, don't buy it for playing games, I don't know why in sleep mode the battery is started draining from the first day I bought the laptop, I think it's because of Mojave updates."

158,1.0 stars,"  Guys - Product might be good, but don't go for the EMI option as its a complete cheating method to us as Amazon will tell us that ""Interest to be charged by the bank will be passed on to you as an Upfront discount"" -- This will never happen as Amazon also will put some interest though we select NO-Interest option and Bank also will put some interest when the detect the money every month -- Overall ITS A CHEATING OPTION to the customer like me :("

167,5.0 stars,"  This product surpassed my expectations.. i did find difficulty initially in shifting from windows to mac but overall it is a great product and very convenient to use once you learn its ways. Its superb for official work and has a wonderful operating system with superb features . Battery life is amazing, sound quality is superior and build is very sturdy. Much recommended for all. (Except Dedicated Gamers!) For gamers I guess Windows PC will be a better alternative. Otherwise go for it."
168,5.0 stars,  Excellent Apple. I have been using windows at home since more than 10 years. Switced to mac now. By just seeing the laptop one can feel the class. Awsome features in Mac. Although requires some efforts to understand mac technology if u have been using windows before. But smooth transition so far. Only thing u need to buy ms office for mac seperately.
169,5.0 stars,"  I had switched to 2017 MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2 thunderbolt 3 ports) from my old windows  laptops and it is really amazing experience to feel the perfomance of this apple product.As I am also a new mac user but, I am writing this review after personally used it.*The build quality ""Not to say anything""Just waaooo...*Battery performance give a huge thumbs up üëç*Display is average ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è you can go through this laptop if there is no need of gaming or complex editing tasks.In 2017 model you will get 2 thunderbolt 3 ports which is best deal."
170,4.0 stars,"  The elegant work of apple can be seen in this product. The design, the user friendliness, the compactness can be easily seen in this laptop. Coming to the performance, the speed of this is remarkable, and you can get to know the power of Mac os when you have another apple product. You can get one of the best movie experiences on this . Overall I would it a 4.5/5."
171,1.0 stars,"  Amazon is proving to be platform for fake sellers who get to display their defective products and sell it indiscreetly even like imac laptops.We bought this, & now it‚Äôs motherboard is not working.

Display resolution should have been better to the price paid but it's better than many other window laptops. Storage is also also low but not an issue."

253,1.0 stars,"  The SSD on My Macbook Air crashed and that too while most of the times I worked on a desk. One fine day the screen froze and the system never restarted normally. I have a folder with ? sign blinking.I cannot blame anyone because the warranty had expired, but nobody would expect the SSD on an Apple device to crash in a mere 16 months. This was my first Apple product purchase and I am sitting with the 1 year old Macbook Air with a crashed SSD. The authorized service center asks whopping INR 40k+ for SSD replacement."

903,5.0 stars,"  I'm a software Engineer by profession. Despite all the criticism I preferred Mac-book air. I would never go for Mac book Pro however.  Here are my reasons:1. Extreme portability:-Its sleek as charm and fits into my regular office bag just like slim notebook. Light weight too. Thus I carry it anywhere with ease.-Now if any coding or programming idea pops into my mind, It gets me going.2. Hardware performance:- Is simply great . I did not notice that it has an internal CPU cooler fan till, once I ran two eclipse web applications simultaneously as client and sever. A windows machine in this situation, slows down like hell, but this guy just started running its fan fast.- Sound is loud enough and incredible. Its gives a great movie experience.-Camera and display are excellent.- Battery keeps going for around 8-12 hours even if Eclipse and browsers are running. Windows laptops last only upto 4 hrs.OS performance:1. I usually hate mac OS but I have to admit, It surprised at times:- I haven't shut down this computer since the 2nd shutdown after buying it 6 months ago. Just put the lid down.- Apps are surprisingly fast and smooth, even though 27 apps are running simultaneously including heavy apps like chrome, opera  and eclipse in EE mode.I rarely give 5 stars to a product, this product deserves it. Kudos Steve!"

1302,5.0 stars,"  After drooling over it for last 2 years (and saving for it) I bought it last week. Finally laid my hands on it yesterday when it arrived in stipulated time in the immaculate apple packing and superimposed Amazon packing in brand new mint condition.First thing that struck me- how utterly beautiful it is. Lightweight. Compact .God ! It looks more wonderful in reality than it looks in the pictures. It is a thing of beauty with a par excellence design - well spaced backlit keys. Setting it up was a breeze - took less than 10 minutes and I was ready to go. I watched a 5 minute trailer of a Hollywood film and the display quality felt divine (after years and years with my office IBM, Dell, Lenovo etc). Video was super sharp and colors straight from the rainbow.Sound quality was good too. Took some 30 minutes to figure out and get my outlook, yahoo and gmail going.Only con I have noticed so far is the lag. There is a definite time lag in opening of apps and execution of commands.I will share more after I spend some more time with it. For now - Ciao."
1303,5.0 stars,  Great laptop.those who are in confused wether to buy it or not due to the screen display isues.trust me no issues with the display.i was also in dilemma wether to buy it or not.but after purchasing it now m satisfied.within 60k its a great laptop.n macos is awesome guys.
1304,5.0 stars,"  Light weight, powerful, long lasting battery, magsafe charger, all the ingredients that make up the macbook air. The display is good enough. It has the ports we use and we can connect external drives. Plus the glowing logo is another plus point. Also the fact that we get iWork, iMovie apps for free makes it more worthwhile. One more cool thing, it wakes up from sleep mode without any break, and saves battery life like a boss"

1306,5.0 stars,"  Delivery was excellent. I was using Dell laptop before this, being a lawyer I was extensively using M.S word and excel, after purchase for about few days it was not easy to understand the pages and numbers with the hectic work which we need to handle, however as the day progressed it was ease and helpful since I had invested in the apple eco-system. But still word and excel are widely used and I need to convert before sending it to my clients. Though their is a export option but still the exported docs file are not compatible fully with widows laptop, for instance if you are using the track change option the deleted sentence/mark up does to appear in the exported docs and still there are few other issues like this. Printers we use will not be compatible with the apple software and their updates in the beginning and we need to run around to print documents till the printer release the update. But there are many advantages of MacBook which includes battery back up + you can easily carry multi task + advantage if you have invested in apple eco system + light weight + easy to move + premium look + till now I haven't seen any slow or virus issue (used for 3 months) + apps advantage + advantage of iCloud (if you are using it) + good for eyes (but I need to keep 13 inch much closure compared to my earlier 15 inch dell laptop). I continue to enjoy this new product of mine....  hope this review helps you in understanding more about the product, ignore spell and grammar"
1307,1.0 stars,"  I purchased this product on 7th March, 2018. It was working well for the first three months. But after that my MacBook Air started acting up. Sudden shutdown and sudden restart started becoming common day by day. It became so common that recently I had to take it to three authorised service provider and all of three of them confirmed that it was due to liquid damage. The most surprising part is there is no way this could've been damaged due to liquid damage. Never have I used any liquid around it and even the moisture content in my room is pretty much normal. After this, I was left with the option to work with the MacBook Air as is OR I had to pay Rs. 45000 to replace the logic board. It is very shameful that this product didn't even last for half a year. This seller is selling faulty product and there is no way I can do anything about it."

1311,1.0 stars,"  Bought it from amazon, and the keys wont work. They show latency and at time done even respond. Bad product!"
1312,1.0 stars,"  For Six month it's worked great... But now it's not working... I can' able to turn on. I contacted Apple costumer care and they given service centre details, when I visited service they deposit my laptop and after 4 day they replied to me (when I called them) that my laptop it's dead because of fungus. But I never wet that laptop then how can it be they replied it's indian weather problem... And it's common problem in this laptop mean Apple Laptop... I recommend you guys be care full this laptop is very sensitive to anything.... Only out side look great but inside its crap... Now it's 8th day and I still my laptop is not fixed I will never buy any Apple products in future 3rd class service"
1313,5.0 stars,"  Good product as promised. If you're entering the mac world for the first time, this would be a perfect start. The product that I received was 2017 model, 13 inch. Be careful, apple says its 13 inch size, but the actual screen size 13.3. Also, don't be tricked with the 128GB SSD, if you're using this for the was it is built for i.e., documentation and presentation (all day office work), it would be more than enough. I coupled this with an 1TB WD Elements hard drive, works like a pro."
1314,5.0 stars,"  I got this amazing peice of machinery at 45,000/- at the sale from amazon loving ever bit of it.Best buy ever."
1315,5.0 stars,"  Mac book air is an excellent laptop. I am a web developer and using MacBook for web dev has been great so far. Mac Os vs windows was a big question for me as I was always a windows user but mac is so much better and simple. I take just a couple of hours to learn. Performance of battery is just awesome. This is the first laptop which I can actually use as a laptop and not as a desktop, as it is so light and portable. And it has a very premiumOverall it is an amazing product. And if you are a professional then it is definitely worth buying. No crashes, quick boot, no virus, no random pop-ups and warnings, excellent performance, fast charging, great battery backup and great appearance. Difference between windows and mac is similar to that of a Honda and Mercedes."
1316,5.0 stars,"  The product is elegant, amazing, durable and light weight. It has i5 processor, 8 GB RAM and 128 GB SSD. It's great for small projects or if any techie is using it as a back up laptop. The battery life is 10+ hours and aluminum body makes you love it.  When people say Apple is overrated , it's underrated. I got it on exchange and even got a 7.5k cashback"
1317,5.0 stars,"  Owning an Apple product is a proud feeling. I was mesmerized after seeing this product. Highly impressed by its fit and finish.I feel MacbookAir is a perfect device for personal use. Now a days, we use personal laptops majorly for browsing and streaming online contents and sometimes documentation of personal stuff. MacbookAir serves this purpose brilliantly. Its core i5 processor is faster and crispier enough to deliver that ultra-fast performance. Sound quality is crystal clear with stereo effect. Battery backup is sufficient for a longer sitting.Its light weight and sleek design makes it easy to maneuver anywhere anytime.Totally a value for money product for me.This trustworthy combo of Apple and Amazon made this purchase (verified on apple india website) an authentic one.Thanks for your patience. Hope this helps."
1318,1.0 stars,"  In less than 3 months, my device has shown serious issues. In about 2 months, there were constant shut down restart issues -- the device was with service centre for a week and they promised it was just a software issue and it was sorted. Today, after 3 weeks of working  fine, the laptop is completely dead. It won't power on!! The Apple support guy wants to replace the mother board... This is my 4-5th laptop in about 12-13 years. I used only windows before this but never had so many problems so early on with any laptop. I don't think I'll ever buy Mac again. And certainly not from an online reseller."
1319,5.0 stars,"  A high quality product, as expected of Apple.  For those used to Windows, someone to give tips on usage (like what is the equivalent of right click) would be helpful."
1320,4.0 stars,"  Almost all laptops with an 8gb ram is above 45K adding another 10k to buy MacBook Air makes absolute sense if you compare the1. physical size of the other laptops2. If you are in search for a laptop don't skip air before actually going to an Apple Store and checking it physically3. You can install windows in MacBook Air, from 2016 apple is officially supporting installation of windows in Mac OS via Bootcamp software it comes preinstalled and all you have to do is point out the path of windows OS and dual boot. And the installation is absolute cakewalk no tech exp needed.4. The booting time is super fast since it works on SSD5. The resolution is std 1440x900 but the output is crisp and you won't feel much of a difference until you are familiar with Retina display.6. The apple logo on the lid is still a headturner7. The keyboard is best in class and is much better than the MacBook Pro, it also have backlit keys which makes better experience during odd working hours.8. browsing and reading websites are much better than the windows anyday.9. You won't find the need to have a mouse with the multi touch recon keypad.10.YOu will adapt to macOS in less than 15 mins.11. The inbuilt speaker is awesome, you will wonder how can this thin device can deliver loud and crisp sound.12. Impressed with the charger cable of MacBook its called MagSafe connector, it completely avoids the damage to laptop by tripping onto charger cable.Cons:128GB storage only, but since I have a 1TB connector and don't store movies and songs can use it smoothly with adequate softwares.No much colours to choose from the only color is silver but the looks are classy"
1321,5.0 stars,  Its really amazing. Exactly the same experience which I heard and described.Macbook air is really best and affordable to all in broad range of costly apple products...!!
1322,5.0 stars,"  Awesome laptop. Super slim. Great battery. Great screen. Working for hours does not harm the eyes, for some reason the low resolution screen seems very beneficial for eyes and long hours of work. Reading text and viewing movies/pictures both seem good and comfortable. I bought it during the sale for 44K. Ordered at 6 AM in the morning. Got it delivered by 7 PM in the evening. Same day delivery. Flawless service. Best laptop that I have seen and used since last 25 years. I like Windows. So immediately I installed Windows also in a separate partition. I have now both MacOS and Windows running on MacBook Air. MacOS is best for non-techie people. Amazing multi-touch trackpad. Keyboard with adjustable backlight is great. 128GB SSD memory makes both Windows and MacOS run very fast. I have also installed Visual Studio, SQL Server on Windows side. Performs very well. No issues at all even for coding work and resource hungry Visual Studio. Apple is great after all."
1323,1.0 stars,"  Update:I had bought it for 44500‚Çπ. After 1.6 years of use, it‚Äôs dead and needs another 46500‚Çπ for logic board replacement. Apple doesn‚Äôt really care about after sales that‚Äôs why their parts are costlier than actual laptop. Pathetic experience. Just because your product looks and feels great doesn‚Äôt mean you cheat customers by giving them pathetic product which becomes dear within 2 years and charge anything for parts. Never go for it unless you are ready to see your apple dead one day out of nowhere.Received this product for an amazing price. Since then my experience has been exceptional. Hadn't used mac book before. Having windows background, wasn't sure at the first if my decision was right. However, this is the best decision. Ease of use, speed, weightless, batter backup, boot time everything is awesome. A never before experience. Thats why apple is apple, you can't compare it with anything else. You will never regret the decision unless you are really unlucky or ignorant in handling it. It's an ornament. Believe me, writing this review after using the device for 4 months. Though the memory a little less, you can always backup your photos online so all is well. Go for it."

1325,5.0 stars,"  Apple MacBook Air has been in my radar for a long time and I was unable to take the plunge. But when I saw the offer for < 45K with cashback of 1.5K and 6 months no interest emi, the decision to buy was easy. I think that this deal is the highlight of the great Indian sale.I was skeptical if it would be a old model. But when I received it I found the manufacturing date to be Aug 2017 and MRP to be 77.2K. Fantastic.I also got a great deal (549) on a sleeve from Amazon Basics to go with this laptop.All in all, a great offer supplemented with cash back and no cost emi, and fabulous one day delivery amazon.Perfect."
1326,3.0 stars,  Product is getting heated while downloading large files. I've kept it ins stable surface no blockage of air  but then also it is getting heated.checked with customer care guys they are saying it is normal.can any body help me through this...
1327,5.0 stars,"  Bought it based on Amazon.in reviews and YouTube posts on mac book air. Would advise any potential buyer to check out 'unboxing mac book air 2017' and other reviews on You Tube, before the parcel arrives.I wasted a few days getting familiar with the mac, downloading apps and documents, before I noticed the right half of the keyboard was malfunctioning. There are articles on google where users complain of the same problem.A buyer needs to get the product running as soon as possible to discover kinks in the machine.The Mac book air is a superb machine.... simply love it, ......tho my heart is in my mouth over the return and replacement ..... and worry that the replacement may have other kinks to be sorted.I would still recommend buying it."
1328,5.0 stars,  Bought it for 50K. Worth every rupee. Switch over from Windows a bit difficult. It has many commonalities with the  IPAD 3 I have been using for  many years now.Best part is that it charges in less than 2 hours and last for more than 12 hours.Great looks and build quality. A great product from Apple
1329,5.0 stars,"  I would like to take some time of mine to say how awesome Amazon really is, I received this product in only 2 business days, with excellent packaging, thanks a lot amazon you just saved me! Now about the product, it's the awesome laptop you'll ever come across and it works so smoothly, Mac is even easier to handle and the OS is a plus point, believe me if you are paying 68K it's worth it."
1330,5.0 stars,"  I kept pondering over the idea of shelling out so much money for a laptop. But after a lot of research, I realised that the specs I've been looking for, come in laptops ranging between 70-100k. Surprisingly, macbook air is the cheapest laptop for the following specs combined in one gadget;slim and light weightpowerful batterysmooth trackpadeasy multitask UIA lot of my friends were against me buying a mac and they still are, but they don't know what they're missing out in a windows. Honestly, my productivity has increased manifold after getting a mac. the pain and time i used to go through in multitasking on a windows has been negated now.Plus, the packaging is great.  Half of the fun is in unpacking the laptop"

1332,5.0 stars,"  As everyone knows any Apple product is outstanding and superior to the rest. Its superb, fast and amazing.I recommend buying the AirCase MacBook sleeve ( black and green ) and the MOCA smooth touch battle hard shell skin cover ( grey colour ). Both these products are on amazon.in. both VERY GOOD and must buy products to help improve your MacBook Air experience. ( I do not advertise or sell these products btw üòÇ )"
1333,4.0 stars,"  Absolutely love this!!!I bought it in Paytm mall for 46k.Sometimes Amazon runs this for 44k, do keep a watch and buy it when the price drops.If you‚Äôre a windows user, you‚Äôll find it really hard to adjust to this (like me!!)The display and battery back up is just too goodAlso it packs a really wonderful photo editing tool.Buy it ONLY if you use your laptop to watch Amazon prime or Netflix and to store your photos"
1334,5.0 stars,"  Excellent, Got at 41,500 Best price"
1335,5.0 stars,"  I got it in a sale for 44999.MacBook air is loved for it's top notch design and function.  It is a timeless product.Display, ergonomics, processing speed, connection reliability, operating system all work in favor of MacBook air.Ideal for working with documents, internet or multimedia."
1336,5.0 stars,  So far so good. After a lot of deliberation and checking and comparing I finally zeroed on MacBook Air.I'm a consultant and my work involves working on mails and Excel spreadsheet. I'm an avid traveler and I wanted a laptop that is light weight yet sturdy. MacBook Air provides the mobility without comprising on performance.I'll write a more detailed review after 30-45 days of rigorous use.
1337,4.0 stars,  3+ Months of Usage: Very good for development purpose. Handles Android studio without any issues.  Best budget laptop for programmers.
1338,2.0 stars,  Maybe I'm an unlucky 1/10 buy really disappointed after receiving a laptop with a keyboard which had defects.Certain keys were not working.Really Amazon??
1339,5.0 stars,"  I got a crazy deal on this and went for it. And it‚Äôs a brilliant piece of machinery. The ease of use, the sleekness to it, the minimal weight. I was very reluctant to switch from windows to a Mac, but the experience has been pretty stellar so far. Great display, great audio, great response."
1340,5.0 stars,"  I've been a strong apple product user since 2011, I've been using a Macbook Pro since then and I don't need to give a review of the same, as it is worth the money and lives up to its reputation. Till date it is working and is very durable, even after very rough usage.Albeit, I was looking for an upgrade of RAM and processor, and I was awed by the new macbook pro 2017, with all its magic and tricks, somethings which kept me away from a impulse buy was that it lacked USB ports, Magsafe adapter, SD card slot.These 3 things were available on Macbook Air, and hence I was wavering between MBP & MBA, untill the Amazon sale happened, I was a bit late by the time I ordered the MBA, the actual deal price was at 44,999. But When I ordered it was at 49,999. I still thought it was a decent price, as comparing its $820 pricing in US market. So I am a happy customer.Now about the product:MBA is a super fast, light weight, spec wise awesome laptop, but it is structurally thin and gives a flimsy feeling that I've never felt with other apple products. Apart from that it works like a charm, you can't game on it. But can almost do everything else on it. The battery backup is a boon.If you're thinking between MBP and MBA, I would recommend go for MBP, although it is expensive and has a few setback. Mainly because of the build. And by no means does this mean, MBA is cheap or having bad quality, I mean it is structurally not as good as MBP.Pros:+ Battery+ Light weight+ Comparatively cheaper+ Its Apple, MacOS....etc, etc..Cons:- Non Retina- Flimsy- Low storage (128GB - Usable 100 GB only, it gets filled damn fast)- Comparatively lower processing power"
1341,5.0 stars,"Apple MacBook Air MQD32HN/A 13.3-inch Laptop 2017 (Core i5/8GB/128GB/MacOS Sierra/Integrated Graphics)Best Laptop as we expect from Apple Brand :) We got this Laptop very reasonable cost. Thanks Amazon to purchase products in very reasonable cost. Also Amazon delivery service is very fantastic, even festival season, we got very quick delivery."
1342,5.0 stars,"  For amazon- I have been really concerned in the sale if the price would come down, but it didn‚Äôt , and suddenly now the price, after sale is lower by 5k. It‚Äôs good that amazon wants to retain a huge customer back up, but the benefits of sale should be given correctly.I have been a windows user since the past 12 years and I was very skeptic about moving to Mac OS, though I‚Äôm an iPad and an iPhone user, and I know how good products apple gives.The specs, after all it‚Äôs 5th gen and the low storage was the concern and a complete change of dynamic in the OS as well.But as I‚Äôm writing today, I would want to say that I‚Äôm more than happy in using Mac.Though only 5th gen, but the hardware software compatibility that apple provides, undoubtedly is the best, and is visible in every sense. All of my devices are now integrated in a complete manner and the Mac OS is so snappy, that there‚Äôs not even a blink of doubt if I made the correct decision or not .Yes, they do not provide MS office, but you can look through YouTube and find many links who would give you MS office 2016 for free.Pros:- Exceptionally light weight- No noise at all, because of ssd- Ssd one of the major advantages as the boot time is only 2-3 seconds.- Exceptional battery- Ambient light sensors- The best track pad among any of the premium laptops in smoothness as well as the tonnes of gestures provided by the OS- MagSafe charger allowing it to charge in less than 2 hours, and a great standby batteryCons:- For people who are really interested in watching movies and storing them, an issue, box of the limited SSD storage.- screen not full hd, maybe an issue to people who really care about the same- price, but when offers are there, definitely go for it"
1343,1.0 stars,  Not working condition
1344,5.0 stars,"  Windows laptops hangs a lot compare to Apples.  Window based laptop are not as beautiful as apple laptop. Apple MacBook Pro is easy to carry with some solid features. Initially, i thought I would face issue on resolution part however, i see no issue, except you want retina screen which doesn't make difference to me as long as i can see to my satisfaction. Features are as good as PRO.YouTube Video rendering is smooth and fast.Price is attractive compare to local store."
1345,5.0 stars,"  There was a problem with initial configuration. Menu selection was bit of a problem due to stiff trackpad click. I was about to return thinking of a defect, but during the second trial I pressed the button hard and everything worked fine.I've been using the laptop for over a month now and everything is working fine.I haven't tried the High Sierra update yet (I am waiting for the teething troubles to subside before going for the OS upgrade.)All ports are working fine, and the laptop is buttery smooth for everyday use.Haven't tried gaming or video transcoding yet.I have seen complaints about display quality and viewing angle, but I do not see any real issues during actual use to endorse it.This is my first experience with Mac OS and I am perfectly happy with it."
1346,5.0 stars,"  Awareness helps ! The 3 Rs of a seller - Ratings (here 98% positive), Reviews (here almost all positive) and Research (continue reading)...Appario Retail Private Limited is a joint venture between Amazon and Patni founders. Not that this should be blindly enough , but enough to mean that if Amazon itself is a stakeowner then you can rest assured to get the best in class service and product both in terms of delivery and quality. Further , with a capital of approx USD $42 million already raised , you‚Äôre sure the seller isn‚Äôt going away in just an year since it‚Äôs inception in 2017Delivery and Seller experience - Super delivery by Amazon (Prime). Ordered on 24th Jan at 4pm and got it the next day at 1pm , thats less than 24 hrs.Product was well protected and packaged. The actual package was seated atop life jackets type air pockets sleeves all around and under it.Bill has the GSTIN number well printed and legible and the serial number is same on the bill and the Mac book and is legit, as Apple‚Äôs product registration portal confirmed it.Product - it‚Äôs a MacBook, period. Been just a day but so far its running all good.Likely problem , or maybe not , will have to wait and see -1) The machine was half charged at 53% which is fine , but in less than an hours use , it drained 5% . I guess it‚Äôs because it was setting itself up and settings up things etc. and maybe after a full drain followed by a full charge it‚Äôll begin to hold up better, let‚Äôs see.2) Apple portal shows warranty to be valid until 6 Dec 2018, that‚Äôs straight 2 months short of the standard 12 month warranty , which would give me until 23rd Jan 2019 at least !!! I‚Äôll write to Amazon about this.Other than that , a perfect machine ! Thanks Amazon !"
1347,5.0 stars,  My first purchase of apple product and its a good one. Completely value for money. The main reason to buy the MacBook was due to the following reasons:1. Unix/Linux like shell2. Good battery backup.3. The ease of install/uninstall of apps.4. No AV requirement unless your Laptop is specifically targeted.5. Very light weight and looks awesome.
1348,5.0 stars,  I should not even write a review for this flawless piece of machine. Its independent architecture makes it an amazing laptop in its kind. The speed is mind-blowing and astonishing.It boots within seconds and maintains industry standards in its performance. Switching from windows to mac which is said to be of a task is just a myth. Its much easy to use a Macintosh than a windows computer.
1349,5.0 stars,  One of best laptop üíª on Amazon I can say. This is my second laptop previously was using Acer aspire. Was very scared while switching from windows to Mac. But it‚Äôs not that scary I can say one of the best stuff. It is more interactive than windows I can say and an awesome experience from Amazon. Thank you very much Amazon to deliver such a great product safely in my hand. Thanks a lot. And my suggestion to everyone guys don‚Äôt hesitate just go for it. It‚Äôs very awesome for daily usage awesome battery backup super speedy. Everything is just above awesomeness.
1350,5.0 stars,  So I‚Äôve been reading reviews and a few got me scared if I would receive the product or something else. But I need to reiterate the fact that we are dealing with Amazon here and there is no need to fear as I‚Äôve received a brand new product and awesome laptop. Additionally this laptop will stand the test of time. It would be very rare for it to ever dissatisfy you. Great beginnings come in great packages.
1351,4.0 stars,"  Pros. Good in built quality. More than 10 hours battery backup.Light weight.Con. Display is average. My 2011 Macbook pro has a better display quality and sound quality.Heats slightly on heavy use.Slow processor.Exchanged Macbook pro 2011 with this product ,apart from light in weight , Macbook pro 2011 is far far better than air.Got 20k discount on exchange and no interest EMI ,effective price was 34kAmazon packing and delivery is xcellent...Update...I have returned the first one because of some small issues with the keys and got a replacement from Amazon in 2 days... I think for this laptop I have got a Samsung display because the quality of the display is much better than the earlier one.I feel the first one which I have received is with an LG display and which was not sharp and crisp.This one also heats up slightly on normal usage and more on heavy usage .But battery 10% equals 1 hour. Again packing and delivery form Amazon xcellent..Update again.... I forced to return the second devise because of crackling speaker and hang up issues... many many thanks to amazon for their prompt service"
1352,5.0 stars,"  Brilliant piece of a machine,5 star for the looks and design5 star for the performanceIt has all the ports and battery life is just wow.. speakers not tat great.The only negative point is screen is not HD, which is very evident. (Maybe purposely avoided by Apple so they can sell Pro).Anyway I‚Äôm a happy Customer"
1353,5.0 stars,  There are no words to define the beauty of this product. MacBook is one of the best thing that I purchased till now. I am techie and using laptops since last 10 years and no other product can beat this. The way it is designed no other product can reach that position. In terms of performance it is very fast. One word for this awesome thing is this is not a laptop this is your hearbeat
1354,5.0 stars,  Macbook Air laptop is super.I like this product so much.Light weight and business friendly.
1355,4.0 stars,"  Really awesome. Bought at a price of Rs.43500. You can use for development without any hassle. Android Studio, XCode, Xamarin, etc works fine and fast. Only concern is the space - 128 gb which get occupied immediately once you install too many development software."
1356,5.0 stars,"  Ohhh Man, Simply Amazing.Bagged it at 49000. Got the delievery on 2nd Day. Thanks Amazon. This is my first macbook experience. If you want to use of just documentation then go for 128 GB otherwise get 256 GB. Because, Always using external hard isnt the good idea considering the damage possibility to your external hard disk."
1357,5.0 stars,"  This is one of the finest and the most streamlined and  consistent product in the 50k price bracket. Bought this one for 60k from Amazon and grabbed another one from paytm mall at 45k. Having used it for 3 months I'm just impressed more than ever. I initially thought it would be unable to game as it's a MACBOOK, but to my surprise this laptop is no slouch when it comes to performance. It can easily handle games build around 2k13 at medium setting with decent framerates(bootcamp off course) The battery backup is out of this world. The design is as good as it gets. The display is fairly decent but not something 4k'ish. And it's thinner than anything in competition. In my opinion it is one of the best laptop you could buy at a price of around 50k. Look out for that price drop as it's frequently available here and there."
1358,5.0 stars,"  I am been using this mac for almost 2 months and its a great product. its slim and handy, using it for web development (i quite use more than 8gb for my applications) but the performance is quite good. with my usage battery last for  8hrs which is quite phenomenal.Boot time is 2 sec which i never seen in any of laps."
1359,5.0 stars,"  I got this product for 49999/- which was great value for money. This is my second MBA, I bought my first one from a seller from eBay for 59,999/- I used it for roughly two years (started developing problems such as trackpad issues, keys not working within a month and finally the airport/wifi stopped working all together). So far so good no defects detected till date and I am hoping it will last me at least another 2 years. Great Seller, it was well packaged and very quick delivery."
1360,5.0 stars,"  The laptop is just so awesome!!!Being a windows user for years, was a bit skeptical on going with this, but my was totally wrong!!!My initial laptop had some screen issues but the replacement though late on the part of amazon, has proven to be an awesome companion with me getting a battery life of almost 12-13 hours...n what more the OS is fast and optimized, and it never lags or crashes like a windows computer...The screen though low in resolution produces amazing colors...n the trackpad is the best I have used till date...Now I understand, why professionals always go for apple macbooks...Bcoz once u use them u ain't going back to Windows.P.S: A star should have been deducted bcoz of amazon delaying the replacement...But the product is so good that it has won me over."

1362,2.0 stars,"  Just the 3rd day of use, and the mouse started showing behaviour like moving all over the screen. After restarting found that left click of mouse not working. There is also issues with facetime app. Camera quality is like 2 mega pixel. Not even close to claimed 720p. Charger getting too much heated up. Seems like apario retail is into some misdoing. Screen back metal have a mild current flow when charging. Apple can't be this bad."
1363,5.0 stars,  Received the product in 2 days without prime membership. So kudos to Amazon for delivering this product in such short span of time. The packing was neatly done and there was a lot of cushion in the box to keep the laptop safe.The product itself is great. Checked Apple's website and I had exact warranty dates i.e 1 years from the date of purchase.The only thing I did not like or I would say liked a little lesser about the laptop is it's keyboard. It's plastic keys. Since I have worked on ones with aluminum this definitely feels a bit off. Though at this price I couldn't really expect for more.The available space on the 128 GB hard drive is about 100 GB (Usable). I will probably have to buy an external drive for the storage. Although I do think that once I install xcode and the other software i need on this machine there will be hardly much space left on the internal drive.The OS version is up to date on this machine.Thanks a lot Amazon I got this for 43500.!!
1364,4.0 stars,"  I was primarily a linux user and was little sceptical before buying but to my surprise MacBook Air is the most affordable laptop which provides the best software-hardware integration experience. I am reviewing it from a developer's perspective.ProsBacklit traditional keyboard and awesome touchpadLongest battery life (gone are the days of finding charging point in a day long conference)Apple ecosystem boasts apps(evernote, spotlight, dictionary, notification, calendar, imessages) which provides the best user experience. Moreover these apps can be easily integrated with Google ecosystem (hangout, google calendar, gmail)ConsSome packages/drivers were not installed by default (homebrew - package manager, USB tethering driver)Had to buy ethernet and HDMI adaptorsI've been using it for a month now and following points are pending for reviewI am a software developer so till now I haven't faced any issue of non availability of a particular software package/application.I haven't tested it with all guns blazing(multiple servers, databases, cache servers all installed locally)"
1365,5.0 stars,  Its been 6 months since I purchased this masterpiece and the feel is still the same as new . Best laptop for coding purposes but not a choice for gaming. I use it for my data science purposes and it is best . The 128 GB SSD is not enough but this fact can be ignored by buying a portable hard drive.Pros:- Long Battery Life- Extremely Portable- Best in this price slot- If you are intermediate programmer this is for you- Backlit keyboard- Fast Charging by Mag safe Charger- SSD (Solid State Drive)- 8 GB RAMCons- No Retina Screen- Not for Gaming purposes- Space is not Enough only 128 GB- Processor is still of 2015 (i5 5th Gen) little bit old for today's generationI think this is the best investment I did. Macbook AIr is Legendary overall.
1366,5.0 stars,  Bought this in deal for 45k.. no cost emi and buy nw pay next year offer.There are many tricks in Mac Operating system. Packaging and Built quality is too good. Loving this laptop.Macbook air boots up in <5 secs because of its SSD storage and battery backup is >8 hrs on continous usage. Also bought Amazon basics laptop sleeve for this device and it fits perfectly
1367,3.0 stars,"  It's a good experience.But getting rid of malware is much easier in windows, though it's more likely to get affected, than in Mac. Yes, Mac does get adware malware attacks.It's really annoying to find it and get rid of it."
1368,5.0 stars,"  There are already thousands of  detailed review of this product on You Tube,Websites and Amazon so I am not going into all those technicalities here in this review. Here i would only like to discuss a few points about which i couldn't  find much on the net or you tube.****The first being screen being only 720p i.e. hd and not being 1080p i.e. full hd.As its a 720p screen so u cannot except it be as good as a 1080p screen but its not very bad as stated on the net. From my personal use i did not find to be bad at all. If you are a normal user like me then the screen should not bother at all. Only those people whose work mainly depends on color accuracy can avoid it for others i feel it shouldn't be a problem. personally I am enjoying the screen.****The second point is that macbook air has only i5 fifth gen processor. But even after having a fairly old processor the machine works like a champ and it performs all the  everydya tasks in a snap. Its not at all laggy or slow because the software optimization is  superb .####### Final thoughtsFor a average user whose tasks on laptop includes web browsing, youtubing, using microsoft apps etc this  is an excellent  laptop under 55k.if you found this review helpful then please upvote it.cheers!!!"
1369,5.0 stars,"  I have received the MacBook on yesterday morning. This is my first mac and I have been waiting for it since the day of placing the order.Cloudtail seller:I have availed the limited time offer of around 10k amazon pay balance cash back and the whopping price around 55k. So ultimately the price came around to 45k.Pros:1. It‚Äôs Apple and as all of you are aware of Apple products build quality, it‚Äôs too compact and well designed with high quality aluminium body.2. SSD replaced the old shit HDD. Dude, it‚Äôs damn too fast.3. Great for beginner level coding. If you plan to start pro level coding or if you‚Äôre a full time coder, go for Pro. Otherwise it‚Äôs perfect for the starting time.4. If you have an iPhone and your iPhone is connected to wifi, you can receive your call on mac itself. Great isn‚Äôt it?5. The trackpad is more than awesome. If you haven‚Äôt used a mac before, you will be mesmerized.Cons:The storage is 128 gigs. Out of 128, you can use 100 gigs only, the rest is used by the OS and preinstalled softwares.- to overcome this shortage don‚Äôt upgrade to 256 or 512 gigs, you‚Äôll bankrupt yourself unless you‚Äôre the owner of RBI(pun intended). Just install software‚Äôs in macintosh drive and use SD card or iCloud for the additional videos or images or docs.Overall it‚Äôs a great laptop in this range.Hope it helps."
1370,5.0 stars,  Got this beast for 44500 during great Indian festival sale ......... Didn't expect such prise for MacBook air last year it was 65000+ ....... Finally happy to have a Mac ......It is more easy and convinient then windows and the best part is it securityI buyed it for programming purposes‚Äã.......Just go for it
1371,4.0 stars,"  Mac air (2017) is decent. No doubt, works very smoothly. If you are going to buy Mac just for uninterrupted day to day work then it would be better to buy a HP or DELL laptop having similar budget and then installing UBUNTU OS in it with Windows 10 . Ubuntu OS runs pretty smoothly. Also, it would be a better choice than Mac air as they (hp and dell) provide much nicer graphics and higher ROM . Don't just buy because it is an Apple product."
1372,5.0 stars,  As expected what else you need other than the feel of Apple product on your hand.Sleek and elegant. Nicely packed and well before time delivery. Thanks to Amazon. A very effective battery with excellent backup of atleast 8-10 hours while you play movies and will be much more when used for office purposes. Heat sink is mind blowing. As a whole it feels like a feather on your hand.Magnetic charger make it look unique. In 1.5 hours it gets fully charged.
1373,5.0 stars,"  My first investment in Apple. Excellent build, top class. Boot times are really mind boggling, even after installing my gold standard Avast AV. Operation is quite different to windows, and takes a while to get used to."

1377,5.0 stars,"  Thanks to amazon for this awesome product at such an affordable price. Amazon's delivery is awesome. I got my package in three layers so there were no damage and the product was delivered one day before the expected date. So this review is for those who think that prepaid online delivery of this much price is not safe. So let me tell you Amazon is completely trustworthy site, i got my product, a brand new one, no refurbished piece, and delivery is excellent. Even i was hesitating before putting this much amount of money for a prepaid order online, but believe me its completely safe.  About the product:---  This mac runs so smooth that you can run android studio with terminal , emulator and many other apps at the same time. The smooth running is because of its SSD and 8gb RAM.It has some heating issue but you can ignore them. So for a normal guy go for it without thinking twice. And for the Android and Web developers this product is awesome. Its drawback is that it has just 128 gb SSD so there may be a storage problem, otherwise it is a great product."

1382,5.0 stars,"  Amazing, love the design, love you amazon for delivery, battery backup is superb. If you have a budget of 50K then go for it. Even other laptops with i5 and 8gb ram cost you around 35 to 40K. But this little beast is best for you."

1387,1.0 stars,"  ""Mackbook Air Logic Board-Failure""I have purchased this device last year in the month of September'2017 and my warranty expired last month and suddenly my MacBook Air has Logic Board Failure. I'm very disappointed with Apple. The Repair cost is almost the same as the price of a new laptop. When I googled about this problem I saw lot of people have the same issues with their MacBook Air.Amazon Customer Care team, please reach out to Apple Care and ask for a recall or repair for all the users who are facing the same issues. We press Apple to do look into this issue seriously."

1390,5.0 stars,"  The product is great. Apple lives up to its expectation when it comes to delivering quality.I got this product at a very reasonable price on Amazon. Here I would like to compliment Amazon for the speed with which the y delivered this product to me .If I have to knit pick a con with this product, then I would say that the screen of this product could have been better. I also use iMac, there is a huge difference in terms of screen quality when it comes to comparing it with the iMac ."

1393,5.0 stars,  In love with this product. Switching from Windows to Mac was easier than expected.
1394,5.0 stars,"  Apple products don't disappoint. The MacBook air is no exception to this rule. It does everything right just the way you could dream of, with a touch of class that's beyond any other manufacturers. I'm simply loving it and probably will never switch back to windows again!"
1395,5.0 stars,"  You always become cautious and careful while buying an item which falls in stretched budget and when your expectations are too high. It happened to me when I was planning to buy a laptop. Before this purchase, I went through many web pages, amazon and flipkart reviews and many others. I was maintaining a wish list for long but was not able to come on any conclusion. And of course, Macbook Air was on top of my wishlist and on amazon top sellers list. But I had few concerns.Display - Recently, one of my friend bought a Lenovo 320E Laptop and I experienced its screen. That was not full HD. That experience was so bitter that I was hesitating to buy any Non FHD laptop. And almost everyone was criticizing the display quality of Macbook Air. But I got to know, only after the purchase that the display is not poor for me anyway. Display is very good while working with all apps provided you know customisation in Mac like Zooming and all. Yeah‚Ä¶ viewing angles are not good.Feeling ‚Äì When I press keyboard, move my fingers on touchpad, carry it in my office, open and close lid, touch surface, I always feel awesome. I haven‚Äôt felt such with any machine; Never.Apple Support ‚Äì Amazing. Serial no of my product was not correct on the invoice. So, I was facing difficulties in registering my device on Apple site for warranty and support. I lodged a request to Apple and they called at scheduled time. The conversation was so very touchy and helpful. That day I realised why Apple is dominating this sector.Sound ‚Äì No complaint at all. Perhaps, some music lovers can find any.Verdict ‚Äì I am not a techie, but I suggest, If you want to buy a laptop only for watching movies, pictures editing, gaming etc, don‚Äôt buy it. And, if you are switching from window and don‚Äôt want to WASTE time in learning of operating a new OS, in juggling with somewhat new keyboard shortcuts, DO NOT BUY it. You can become frustrated while operating an all new OS for you. You can find some compatibility issues also like non availbility of optical drive, no support for Chinese accessories and all. If you don‚Äôt use cloud space for storage, you also may face difficulty with data storing as it is having only 128 GB SSD.If you can ignore above, then this is for you. Around 50K, you will not find any machine like this. Buy it because IT JUST WORKS."

1397,5.0 stars,  Awesome job by Amazon. Bought from cloudtail india. The product warranty is counted the date it is turned on for first time. It will get you a lot of attention everywhere because of that glowing logo. Go ahead without any doubt. It will last twice a Windows laptop. And after all it's a MACBOOK. Game Over Windows.
1398,5.0 stars,  I went to the apple store and found the representatives very unresponsive to my queries. I found all my questions answered here in amazon. Decided to order on line.

1405,5.0 stars,  If you are like me looking for a laptop for coding or other day to day purposes then go for it without any hesitation.The product was delivered by amazon with great packaging ensuring that the device is not damaged.The first boot takes a bit of time so do not panic its natural. After the initial setup is done it should boot within 20-25 seconds.The device is really light weighted and its sleek design just mesmerizes you.With a 12 hour battery life you can comfortably go throughout the day without having to plug it in.The LCD display though not HD is still pretty good.Finally I just want to say that it is an amazing product and you should definitely go for it!

1427,5.0 stars,"  The Mac Air heats up while charging but that's a common problem with Macs. It doesn't do much damage to the laptop. Everything else about the laptop is better than most products in this price range. The storage is low but you can attach an SD card or keep a hard drive with you. All in all, the pros outweigh the cons on any day. A highly recommended product."

1597,1.0 stars,"  This just to highlight the type of service I got from iCare in Bangalore. Paid twice (INR 4k) just to get the Macbook Air diagnosed which is just 1 year 6 months old. And then i got a WOW factor...Diagnosis Details: Checked and Found device is not powering on. Did SMC, PRAM and checked with known good power adapter - Still same issue, Cleaned and reseated all the connectors and checked - No go, Checked the device with bare minimal configuration and power on pads - same issue. Suspecting issue in Logic board, hence need to replace the logic board under exchange price to check further.Amount to be paid Rs.48248üò≥,Not getting any answer why? Is this Apple.... what a customer support. In-fact the service Guy informed that these issues are frequent with MacBook Air. This is the worst Service support have ever got from any Brand....."
1598,5.0 stars,"  Apple always design with perfection. No doubt, this macbook Air stands first in this prize range (50k).First about the delivery, got this product delivered within 2 days and amazon transportation service was really very awesome. With required air bags and dual protection.About the product.Design : 9/10Aluminum body carved with perfection, sleek and very elegant look. The apple logo that glows adds cherry. Backlight keyboard is perfect for working in dark. Gesture controls in trackpad are awesome. There are about 10 geasture controls that help you work with just your fingers. The design only lacks in air ventillation. The alluminium body gets heated up when i render video edits on premier pro. For normal work, it works fine.Performance: 10/10Although its a 5th generation i5 processor, but this works far better than the 7th gen i5 processors in windows laptop. Compared intensive rendering task and this mackbook air is upto the expected mark. Thanks to the optimization, that apple always do. 8GB ram, intel HD6000 graphics is just perfect for regular work and even works fine for small scale coding and professional video editing tasks. This mackbook air boots up in around 3 seconds and sleeps in around 2sec.Battery: 10/10The best battry life i had ever experienced in any laptop. Works for around 13 hours in a single charge (continious internet surfing and online videos). Battry do gets exhausted when using professional software (adobe premier pro)(cpu intensive task).MacOS Sierra is definitely all you need. Preinstalled apps helps you to do all your school, college or office works in one place. No need to download or buy MS office. iMovies is just perfect to edit small scale videos.Storage: 9/10SSD 128 gb is superfast and really makes your work lightning fast, but you need to buy an additional external hard disk to store files and other stuffs.Magsafe2 charger is just awesome, no damage to the charging port and pin as it gets plugged in through magnetic force. No wear and tear around charging port. Also prevents accidental damage.Thunderbolt 2 post perfectly works fine with add on connector (aroung 500Rs) for HDMI streaming. 2 USB 3.0 Ports are good but it could have one one USB post.All around, This laptop is perfect for everyday use and small scale professional use"

1609,5.0 stars,"  Update After 3 weeks of usage :It is worth every penny. After charging battery fully once, it starts giving backup of 10-11 hours. Do remember to charge it full for few times in the beginning. Boot time is like 5-8 seconds. I am a programmer and I am able to run multiple IDEs at once and it runs without a glitch. Go for it. I tried many windows laptop but this is way ahead than my 1 lakh Dell Latitude Laptop.Old ReviewI really bought it for better battery life and a handy laptop. But it looks like the battery is little bit of problem here. In my last few days of usage, I always have to keep it up on charging and after fully charging it it works only for few hours not 10-11 which is being promised everywhere. I did every test I could and it passed all the test but the battery is draining very fast. Shall I ask for a replacement?"

I am running many of software like DB , Java , Docker , Node JS , ELK etc., but still without hung of OS still I can use I am really impressed with that.Let's talk about Pros and Cons of this Laptop and how your going to spend extra money to repair later.Pros :Screen goodSound quality is goodLimited access for software like window has and All you have to pay from your pocket.Quality of hardware is good.Good OSSecurity no one can beat itAccess of Mac is really simple.Cons :Easily heat while Charging.If your programmer and don't expect it will be long live.Easy Liquid Damage after 2 years of use and You have to spend more than 30K to repair in Apple Store.Back light issue after liquid damage resolved because back light fuse will going to burn because of MB.Mother Board will going to die soon after fix back light issue and RIP your Mac and buy another one after 3 years.This is reason why apple become 1 trillion company on earth to loot customer name of service , low quality of inner part of device which will not live more than 3 years.Today still I am using iphone 4s without any issue but now days dont trust apple to give quality of product."

Then they had shut down all the shops. But yet my warranty lapsed during the lockdown.Service=0No matter how good thing you purchase there's no use of it if the service is that poor.For any other laptop on earth I could just make a call and they'd send engineer at home. That's not the case with Apple in Inda (esp this country)."

1657,1.0 stars,"  To begin with I have to say I have MacBook Air 13 inch which is dead now. Why I mention a risky bet because if you‚Äôre not in warranty you‚Äôre gone if something happens. I bought the machine for 65,000 and now since the motherboard is gone which costs around 50,000 and no proper service centres I‚Äôve to buy a new laptop.Apple with not help at all except some trouble shooting steps calling 0009001009009 and that‚Äôs it. Every time service centres will cost you around 1,700 for just opening the laptop (diagnostics drama) and make a false report so to become PREMIUM service centres in the apple service locator page.Not a bad machine though but if you‚Äôre not a sort of rich guy who can afford another one at any time and instead buying this for some hope of 2/3 years lasting please reconsider this.Now I‚Äôm forced to buy a windows laptop. I‚Äôve no option left as apple don‚Äôt have their self stores yet in India which will be in future but none now.Anyway don‚Äôt take this as I‚Äôm writing because of my anger for the problem. I‚Äôm just making an honest review. Anyhow to show off to the public you can buy apple MacBook with logo half eating apple is most welcome..I‚Äôm attaching pics of my Mac. It‚Äôs over 1 year and not a scratch yet. But service centre people will sign you a declaration that there are scratches even if there aren‚Äôt any........** Apple call centre executives will talk so nicely that you will feel like the best after sales service one will get but slowly slowly you will learn. There‚Äôs a saying that ‚Äú‚Äù‚Äù‚ÄùExperiences and only experience can make a person understand nothing else‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù"
1658,1.0 stars,"  I had bought a mac airbook in 2017, now after 2years moderate usage, i find it just not powering up. Went to authorised service centre called 'Planet care' in Jayanagar Bangalore, First shock was they say to open and inform us of the problem the charges are 2500/-. Next shock is you cannot retrive your data because ironically SSD IS MOUNTED ON MOTHER BOARD AND HENCE WE HAVE VERY LESS CHANCE OF DATA RETRIVAL. If we had SATA hard drive which is 1/3 price of Apple.. we are assured of our back up. Never thought Apple can fool people.. i am still recovering from it.. because  Apple charges premium for their SSD. will never buy apple product ever again as i feel they not only charge premium on thier products but also the repair is Royal Premium. Now comes inconvinence part... i need to wait for a week now minimum  as the service centre is flodded with repairs. So please judge by urselves..how bad the product is. I spent around 30 minutes in their service centre but could have saved lakhs of rupees for my future as i was very much convinced by seeing the visiting customers and thier apathy...not to buy apple by paying premium price, because it is again same dam gadget...which will go bad like other gadgets..but atleast they dont charge you ransom for the last rites."

1671,1.0 stars,"  Recently I purchased MacBook Air 13.3. From Amazon.I was shocked to see that on pressing ""Y"" key Z letter was getting printed  and on pressing ""Z"" key Y letter was getting printed.The customer care proactively addressed the issue and arranged a Technical Service at home. My question is - Are we  OK after spending a huge amount to receive a Defective product. So I have ordered an return request not replace Since this time I will directly walk in and buy it from authorized showroom.Guys if you still order from Amazon please make sure to check each keyboard keys and complete Keyboard functions. I think I was lucky to catch the defect at the very first go.Why Amazon is not taking care of it.Is Apple started making defective products.At the end of the day we Endusers have to suffer.I received my replacement MacBook air but unfortunately again the Apple  Authenticated seal is broken.I have not accepted the product.Guys please do Check your products since you are paying a heavy price for it.Lots of Refurbished products are also available.Amazon India is proving its failure in Indian market by selling products from Unreliable sources."

1703,1.0 stars,"  I‚Äôm giving an honest review after 3 years.  MacBook air previous models are having a lot of issues such as dead motherboard, screen issue and a lot more. Let me tell you, not only me but the majority of the people have faced this issue. If your warranty has expired, Apple will ask for more than 44k to change the motherboard which is not worth to spend on such laptop because you can get a good & new laptop in that range in another brand. And the second thing is that Apple is still charging more than 70k for the outdated model which is not worth at all. Either they should discontinue the previous mac air model or lower the price by taking all the previous damage model & repair it for free or consumer would lose trust from this brand. After facing this issue, I won‚Äôt spend 40k+ for the repair in apple care nor I‚Äôll buy in MacBook ever. This brand has disappointed me a lot."

1727,5.0 stars,"  Delivery: One day early in perfect condition. No damage at all, thank you Amazon for that.After using it for a monthPros:1. Light-weight, easy to carry, takes less place. Portability 5 out of 5.2. Battery life. Trust me you won't get a battery backup like MacBook Air. Tested for all kind of work e.g. games (5 hours [tested for Counter strike source]), movies(9 hours), reading and writing (10-11 hours). No doubt 5 out of 53. Keyboard, keys are perfectly spaced for ease-in typing. Backlight available. Again 5 out of 5.4. The display is good enough for watching movies. 4k print not tested so can't comment. 4/55. Speakers powerful enough to hear songs and movies (depends on your movie quality too). 4/56. Two USB 3.0, SD card slot, Headphone jack and MacSafe charging all works perfectly.7. SSD hard drive boot laptop in few seconds. Copying large files now takes lesser time. Smooth multitasking and multiple desktop option make tasks easier. 5/58. Trackpad, multiple gestures, very easy to use, a lot of space (quite big). 5/5Cons:1. Space, only 128gb SSD, 30 gb already occupied with system files and preloaded apps. So Please carry your external hard drive at all times.2. No serious gaming. Buy genuine games if buying a mac. Can run windows application using wine software(personally not recommended).Recommended:Use Paragon tool for mounting your external hard drives. Can download paragon tool for free from Seagate official website.Might take time to adjust from a Window User to Mac, but you won't regret your decision.Overall MacBook Air is ideal for all kind of work except for heavy gaming. So go for it :)"
1728,5.0 stars,"  This was my first experience with mac. I needed a laptop which doesn't need too much attention and is fast and sleek. I had always used windows laptops and Pcs in the past, but had heard of the macs being very fast and user friendly. Also I needed it to use Final Cut Pro which is fastest video editing tool. So I made the decision to move to mac and buy the cheapest in the lot, I had read lots of reviews and had seen unboxing and review videos, all of them complained about the poor display quality, as the lcd panel is 720p only and all of them wanted a 4K display. Still i chose to buy Mac book air, as I had in the past used 720ps laptops and display wasn't a priority to me.After having used this for past few months, I got used to the New mac OS, took me few google searches to understand it. but its damn convenient to use. Some of the impressive parts I have listed below.Battery seems to last for ever.There is no Visible air vent, and speaker vent (I was surprised how does it work and where the sound was coming from)Touch pad is so good that it feels better than a mobile's touch screen.The charger is so Small you won't believe it. (many laptops come with a bulky charger)The way power adapter connects to the Mac with magnetic strip gives a futuristic feel.The mac is so meticulously built and designed that you will love its every curve.(I don't want to romanticise about it but you could fall for it)And above all the MacOS is so good, that the jittery feel of random softwares and drivers missing in windows will not bother you here.#3 words to summarise it ALLFluid Fast & Beautiful"
1729,5.0 stars,"  Amazing product man, simply amazing. Basically if you're okay with Mac OS then close your eyes and go for it. Because at this price you won't get any windows laptop with a better build quality and performance (not gaming performance). Trackpad - Top notch...Keyboard - Amazing key travel. and we all know how good is. apple's build quality. ;)Loved it.P.S. Trust me I've done my research on laptops, this is the best pick in this category(under 60k)."

1732,4.0 stars,"  Hi folks!I have purchased this MacBook from Amazon itself, I am writing this review after using it for around 3months. Initially I was confused (like most of the persons) that should I buy MacBook or Windows laptop? After a long research I have come to the conclusion that MacBook is good for me, though both of them have their own pros and cons.Summey of points which I collected is here, posting it for the benefit of others, also mind it‚Äôs my perception and it mayn‚Äôt be always correct for all cases.1. For this price tag you have limited number of Windows laptop of good brand and similar configuration.2. This is very sleek and aesthetically appealing laptop as compared to most of other laptops.3. Battery backup is best possible as compared to others.4. Viruses are almost nil for Mac.5. Bluetooth connectivity is easy in Mac (my own experience)6. Audio quality is best (with or without headphones) as compared to others.7. Apple logo makes it appealing üòâ(however not related to functionality).Now here is why Windows is good1. It has more compatibility (like HDMI output, reading files etc)2. More softwares are available (cracked software works better, however we should not use them).3. Windows is comparatively easier to work with (my own perception).So finally, if your requirement is a machine which is more reliable, better battery, durable and sleek (works better in tours and journeys) go for MacBook.If you need to do experiments with laptop (like cracked games and software) and have no experience of Mac need more connectivity and free or cheaper software and hardware, go for Windows.Both are good in their own ways."
1733,4.0 stars,"  Okay. So you have been seeing people display their Macbooks and you have always fancied owning one of those premium devices. Now, as Amazon offers this Macbook Air at a reduced price, you are getting tempted to buy this. STOP and consider what you get for the money you spend. Do not buy this if you think this adds some premiumness to your profile. It will not - because this device is next in line where support will be withdrawn by Apple. Resist temptation - because THAT is what Apple sells. The last reason to buy should be your feeling that it improves your profile. Apple users will smirk when they see you with an obsolete 'dinosaur' device as they display their latest toys.If you are a windows user - better go to some friend's Macbook and try some activities. MAC OS is great till you try to change something as puny as your mouse cursor!! You realise that you are stuck in the little cozy jail of Apple once you try anything non-standard. Try transferring data by a USB stick from your other laptop to this one .... you will need training. USB partitioning has to be only ExFAT - and evn if you do this partitioning on a MAC, chances are that Windows will not recognise the USB stick. If you are not a power user - this can be a real pain. Of course, you can pretend (like so many thousands of Apple users) that these do not matter. But hey - they do. A premium DELL or HP may be the best option for you. (Yes, I will first discourage you from buying this and then explain why I purchased this for myself)Know that you are giving up the option of buying RAM or SSD from the neighbouring shop to extend the device life. You wil depend on Apple and on Apple alone. Of course there are generic spares - but these too are more expensive than the DELL or HP spares. Once Apple pulls the plug of support, these spares may get even more expensive. In fact, hardware upgrade beyond increasing the SSD is very much a rare luxury. Thankfully, I have kept myself out of this snob-race that Apple peddles.If you are still reading - here are the good sides (why I purchased this in spite of what I wrote above)A Mac is a Mac is a Mac. So is this one. The hardware are perfectly matched and performance is always optimal. This laptop is for carrying along as a second laptop, alongside my official one, a DELL workhorse. MAcbook Air is lightweight and can run other operating systems. I use this to run Windows and Linux.The MAC OS is a very stable Operating system. Chances are that you will never face a single crash in your lifetime of using this Macbook Air. Windows is fragile (too many bugs and updates) and Linux is difficult (you need a little training). That's where the Macbook Air comes in Handy. With Parallels desktop, you can load Linux and Windows on Virtual Machines on the Mac. You can seamlessly go from one OS to another without rebooting. However, note that with 'parallels desktop' you are operating Windows and Linux from your little cell in the Apple jail. And be prepared to shell out a good amount to ""buy"" this software. It is possible to load linux differently so that it works outside the Apple shell. Quite a saving grace. Using BootCamp (through a dual bootng feature), you can take advantage of the multi-tasking power of Windows without the risk of getting blue screens or hanged functions. So overall that looks great.Now coming back to my rating... I run mostly Windows and Linux on this MAC. Happy with it because the hardware is great. I consider myself a power user - so I know that I can find alternatives for this if and when Apple pulls the plug of support (should be available for at least another year, and a certain period after that as Apple's support to ""obsolete"" devices). Hence a durability rating of 3 stars only !!That (above) is the truth laid bare. Please decide and buy at your own risk.~~ Buy this if you like the hardware (but know that DELL or HP would give a much better hardware at this price, and those will be upgradable and last much longer than this)~~ Buy this because you understand that this hardware is very stable and Mac OS can protect your windows as it works in the MAC Shell. Buy this because you can run Linux once Mac makes this obsolete.~~ Do not buy this if you feel it adds to your premium value. It will be a dinosaur soon and you will be left stranded. Think of the plight of iPhone 5, which was premium 24 months ago. People rushed and purchased their ""cheap iPhone"" around a year back. Today, they have no pride in showing off a device that is obsolete. Tomorrow, Apple will make it sluggish and they will be forced to upgrade.EDIT/ADD [02/12/2019]: If you plan to upgrade your SSD to 500GB, please look at SSD (ASIN:B07J2WBKXF) with adapter (ASIN: B07D7VM8GM). I have been able to successfully upgrade myself. Review is on the SSD page."
1734,5.0 stars,"  It is Air! Light as feather and Smooth like butter!Performance is wonderful! I have been using it for last 15 days! and am really happy!Battery life is awesome, and boot up time is really short!Great Product!!"
1735,5.0 stars,"  Awesome ultraportable notebook. great battery backup and performance. if new to apple macbooks, must buy to get accustomed to macOS. recommend everyone to go for it whenever there is a sale."
1736,5.0 stars,"  I have been a Macbook pro user for last 2 years. I came across the new Macbook air and got a chance to put hands on it. So here is a brief review on my first impressions. Basically i will be comparing this with a regular laptop of similar price range and Macbook PROAir benefits compared to Non Apple laptop:# Slim and light weight for daily travel# 10-11 hours battery backup on normal usage# Apple touch pads are awesome, smooth and responsive compared to any premium laptop# Audio quality on speakers is good, but not as loud as my Macbook Pro 13# Apple front camera works the best in low light, best for low light skype calls# SSD - Apps launch very fast despite the low power processor# Metal body construction# Mag safe charger- If you are really careless this helps very much.# Ambient light sensor that adjusts brightness automatically ( Many people are not aware of this feature)# Keep your Air closed or leave somewhere idle and check back after 2 or 3 days, you will see battery has dropped less than 3 or 4 %# The best part - Mac OS, contains all that you need, a neat calendar, Todos app, notes, Quicktime, Mail app etc. Hassle free OSAir demerits compared to Non Apple laptop:# Performance is on lower side# Good for basic usage only, internet, movies, video calls, spreadsheets, mail# You will get better display(Full HD) if you buy a 999$ Ultrabook from US (In India they come at premium)Should you consider Macbook PRO? - PRO advantagesI know a lot of people might be confused whether to go with PRO for some additional bucks. So listing benefits of pro from my experience# Force touch - More comfortable touch pad, less finger pain compared to buttons on Air, Adjustable pressure# Retina display - More pixels, Better viewing angle. Air is 1440x900 while PRO is 2560x1600 pixels# Better performance - Pro CPU is actually about 50% faster than AIR, but in real world tests, apps launch at similar speed in both PRO and Air. The difference is notable only when you run CPU intensive tasks like Programming, Video encoding, Photo editing, Raw conversion etc. Those who are not into this can go with Air and save some money.# Newer CPU -  Macbook air has not evolved much compared to PRO. The 2017 Air uses the same fifth generation CPU as the previous version (2015). But with a little upgrade in CPU speed. ie 1.6 GHz to 1.8 GHz. The newer PROs come with 7th generation Intel processors. The difference is mainly with the energy consumption.# HDMI port - You don't need display port adaptor# New keyboard - The 2016 PRO has the same keyboard as the ""Macbook"". Keys are less deeper and more wider. This makes it little more comfortable to type. Air comes with the same old keyboard as 2015 PRO# Wider touch pad - Not a big deal. But if someone loves that, its a bonus# Color options - Yes, Air is only available in Silver, PRO comes in 3 color optionsIf you think, all the above justifies the price difference between the PRO and Air, go for the PRO. The only benefit that Air offers is battery life. PRO offers 8-9 hours only, while Air offers, 11-12 hours battery.Whom Air is for?Macbook air is not a gaming machine or for hard core users. Its for people who love to watch lot of movies, work on documents, browse and some basic programming. When i say programming, Xcode works fine on Macbook air. But Software like Android studio, Photoshop seems to struggle a little on Air. But if you are once in a while user of intensive apps, you can ignore this.I will update my review with more details after a few weeks of hands on testing and usage. If you have any queries leave a comment below. I will try to answer in a day or two.[...]! Thanks"
1737,2.0 stars,"  Ok , see idk why apple is even selling this piece of crap right now in 2020 it's outdated hardware like my god it's a 5th gen i5 , they brought out their new air people should just have a better luck buying that better hardware (yes no usb A but 2 usb thunderbolt 3 is wayyyy better ) of you want to write documents and other stuff and dun want anything else (cause you clearly blind ) it's simple try windows dun just buy it cause it's apple (yes I do have a MacBook 13  and I love it ,so I ain't a windows fan boy  ) just say with this hardware please go buy something else ,for coding too if you are serious about it it will help no doubt a 1 core CPU can help too ,but if you are working you need the speed which oh god you won't have with this,but on a budget and if you are clearly not gonna do anything else so buy a widows laptop and instal Linux , and if you just wsnt to use office still buy a Windows , it's simply better there, Lenovo Asus has such powful systems now with such prices that it's stupid to buy it , unless you have the cash for the new MacBook air , then just stick to Lenvo or Asus and just get a sticker of apple and apply it , it's pathetic but hey it just works"
1738,5.0 stars,"  I have read a few reviews where owners are saying that one cannot use a usb or hard disk with the macbook air, as it cannot read ntfs and you need to format a hard drive into fat32 just to read it, well that's not exactly true.  It's true that the mac os does not natively support reading and writing on a ntfs formatted hard drive, but you can get around that by installing a nifty little software called NTFS for Mac. Its a paid software, but is a must.Once installed you can read a d write on any external harddrive which is in ntfs.The other thing you need is a software called Anddroid file transfer, which is for reading your android phones, keep in mind that with the catalina update support for utorrent is withdrawn from the apple eco system, so instead install anothe torrent client called Transmission.Now there are some compatibility issues with Pages and Word as certain fonts of Word are missing from Pages so you can identify them like 'Calibri' and install them, remember by default Pages use Helvetica Neue, so choose a font like ,'Times New Roman' and export the file you are working on as word, dont simply save them otherwise it wont open on a windows computer.There is a learning curve to it, but there are plenty of tutorials on YouTube for that. Finally, the battery life is something, my macbook is over a year and a half old but still i need to charge it only every couple of days, after heavy usage.So yes, for portability its, great, very snappy to open apps like a high end mobile phone, only downside is ssd size is quite small, but i use a external harddrive for storage purposes."
1739,5.0 stars,"  I am writing this review on my MacBook Air. Firstly, Thanks to Amazon for everything, to send it safely to me. I use it now on a daily basis and I am quite impressed with the overall feel and looks of this laptop. Though the transition from Windows to Mac was quite tough, you become used to the New options that come in form of Keyboard and Mac OS. The Lightweight laptop is easy to carry around and comes with the New MagSafe connector, which is a Gem in itself. I tried the MagSafe feature and it saves your Laptop from Accidental pulls and breakage.P.S: I bought it at a cost which was not available anywhere else. Thanks to Cloudtail team and Amazon for making it possible."
1740,5.0 stars,"  Very reliable laptop. Although comparatively looks expensive against Windows, but there many under the hood key things.1.  It‚Äôs a SSD - not traditional hard disk. Windows laptops with SSD starts with more than 20% cost than air.2. Build quality - very sturdy aluminium build.3.  No virus - no need of antivirus softwares. There are no virus threats on Mac OS.4.  Works amazingly well if you have iPhones or other iOS devices. Hand off, continuity is simply brilliant.5. All leading productivity apps like Microsoft Office are available natively. They work better than their Windows counterparts.6. Portability - feather light weight.7.  Battery life - 10 hours + battery in one charge."
1741,5.0 stars,  My son gave this as my 64th year birthday gift..I was looking for a real lightweight and portable laptop. A good change from the windows based laptops that I have been using for over 2 decades. Liking the Mac experience..Easy to learn. Great power backup. No hesitation in recommending to just go for it.
1742,5.0 stars,  As everyone know its Apple and its an awesome product for Apple gadget lovers.Amazon packed this into a big small box and then into a big box to deliver it safely. They deliverd it next day.
1743,5.0 stars,  Previously i was using windows laptop...had some apprehension for going in for macbook.....but after purchasing this macbook i have found it to be toooo good...its easy to use........and the best part it the macbook air looks stunning....love it....
1744,5.0 stars,  Very good laptop with Premium looks and premium priced. Got it during this Diwali sale. Nice packing and delivered on time. I am disappointed with price fluctuations. It has reduced by 2000 rupees during the Diwali sale itself. I lost 2000 INR by buying it early on first day of sale.This is my update after 3 weeks of use. I added office 2016 and bitdefender antivirus to this system. This combo is great experience. Bitdefender tops the list of antivirus for mac and I am satisfied with the addition. So far going great.
1745,5.0 stars,"  One of the best laptop in the range of 55-60k. After using it for more than a month , I am totally satisfied with its Mac High Sierra OS. The OS is ultra smooth. Which actually best for the hardware provided by them. If someone need a laptop having good looks, ultra portable (now a days ultrabooks even cost more than this on) , battery backup of more than 8 hours, standby time is more than 20 days (in a single charge) and ultra smooth user interface then go for it, either you can have other laptop in that price segment. And it is better to buy from online store than the retail store or apple store because it will cost about 77k."
1746,5.0 stars,"  Wow!! It was a deal breaker getting a MacBook Air for 45k where in it starts for at 999$ in USA.The MacBook Air runs mostly cool and silent. The aluminium-body design is very attractive.It has pretty neat hardware. It uses a fast Core i5 processor and has 8GB RAM. The SSD in it makes all the difference in the speed, even though storage is limited to 128GB in the entry-level variant. The 13-inch screen is big enough and although it is not ""retina display"", it is still one of the best in its class."
1747,5.0 stars,"  Bought during grate Indian festival (9-12 August) at 58990 Rs and will get 1500 cashback.People, please buy from ""Cloudtail"" seller if you want 100% genuine and fault free product.Other sellers selling at cheap rate are not reliable.It's giving me more than 12+ hours battery backup.I'm windows user from long time, but now I'm getting used to MacOS slowly.It's not that grate like some people tell, and in my opinion it's not comparable to windows. Windows is better than MacOS.Performance and boot time is amazing.Worth the money üòÄ"
1748,1.0 stars,  Please Dont buy Products from JAKS..This seller is selling defective MAcbooksGot the first macbook it was defective once i turn it on it was showing contact apple/support.  Amazon replaced it with one more macbook from the same seller JAKS. Got the macbook and started using it. After 5 mins of usage the macbook is getting red hot. the base of the macbook and keyboard area is getting hot aggressively and i can hear the fan noise. No 3rd party heavy softwares are installed on mine. NO wonder amazon is selling macbooks at such a low price.
1749,1.0 stars,"  Worst decision ever to buy a Macbook Air 13 inch 2016 model, in 2016 for INR 65000.Even then it was under discount as the MRP was INR 81900 and I used up my last penny to buy this stupid thing. I did not buy Apple Care with it and just as 1 year was over, I got this pink vertical line on my screen. I took it to an Apple Store and they said they have to change the screen, cost INR 20000. One third of the cost of Mac in just one year. ‚Ä®Maybe not all products are bad, maybe my luck was so bad that I got that one faulty product. Still, vertical pink lines, I never got those in my Desktop or any other laptop. Never heard any other brand has it. Why is this weird issue with Apple only. I googled and found many people had this problem.I decided to let it go, it was just one line. No Sir! The number of lines increased. And now 3 years later I have some 35-40 lines but of different colours. So many lines that it is hard to even read on this stupid device.Maybe this is a marketing strategy, once the warranty gets over, screw up the devices so they can come to get those repaired. Well, if this is a strategy, Sir, then you just lost a customer. I get that I was not a very valuable customer but still, a customer.I have no other option buy to use it, buy honestly it is not going to last another year. So cost comes to 65000/4 which is  INR 16250 per year. So not worth it.This amount may not mean much to other people, but for me it was a 3 month salary. ‚Ä®There is not much I can do anyway now except write this review and take it as a life lesson,‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go after luxury products which are out of your saving account‚Äôs league.‚Äù"
1750,2.0 stars,  After two weeks we had problem with the fan and we had to give it at the service Center to replace the same. After spending so much it's very disappointing to see that we received a defective piece.We were unlucky that only two weeks time was given for return of the item.Not satisfactory
1751,4.0 stars,  For a programmer... It's best. Android studio runs very smooth. Totally in love with it. Worth it's price.
1752,1.0 stars,"  After using it for more than 3 months, here is my list of pros and cons:Cons:1. Keyboard quality is not upto the mark. Keys feel cheap. Delete key is faulty and got permanently pressed as can be seen in the screenshot. No return window now.2. Touchpad feedback is not good. It misses the taps in some regions intermittently.3. Small screen and strain on eyes if working for long hours. No anti glare.4. Very small storage of 120 GB.5. CPU speed is 1.8GHz only.Pros:1. Good battery life.2. Good looks.3. Good performance due to SSD.I've mentioned Cons before Pros because overall I feel it's not worth its high price.The satisfaction level is even less than my Dell vostro laptop which is less than half its price.Any budget laptop can be upgraded to SSD in very less cost.Buy this only if it's a necessity or if you believe in show off."
1753,3.0 stars,"  Its ok, there was too much price fluctuation on the product. It was 56000 one day and immediately shoots up to 59000, I know that's the marketing strategy. But we all still look for the best price isn't it? Took me 2 months to see how the prices are to purchase it. No doubt Apple is the best. I have been an apple user for over 7 years now. Little hiccups here and there but its ok."
1754,1.0 stars,"  I wish I could give Amazon o stars. No wonder mac is awesome product but buying it on heavy discount on amazon made me regret big time. This is only second month to my purchase and it started showing up problems when taken to apple centre they say mother board has to be replaced. Not sure if amazon sells defects tie products on heavy discounts. I am a frequent and loyal buyer from amazon but I have simply lost trust in them as my almost 55k product has gone for a troll. You are a shame! Mac has also let me down as they were suppose to provide best in class products now what they have in justification is that it shouldn't happen but we will replace the part coz it is in warranty. Imagine had it not been in warranty period, my hard earned money invested on this effing product would have gone into trash. Big thumbs down for amazon India and mac who make fools out of customer and not giving them full satisfaction. Even the executive seated at service centres give least explanation as to how a new product can show such defect. Useless people"
1755,4.0 stars,"  Good Product. Delivered in 2 days. Light weight, slim, easy to carry. I've replaced my Inspiron with Macbook and it is quite good decision. Since it has 8GB Ram that is enough for home user and 128 ssd drive might be drawback for you but you can buy external hd accordingly in case of need."
1756,1.0 stars,  charger not working after week use
1757,5.0 stars,"  Nicely delivered on time... quite happy..Disappointed with apple, its slow in processing... Apple must change ""made in CHINA"" to made is some US/Korea/IndiaMy windows is much faster and User friendly."
1758,1.0 stars,"  It is excellent in most of the parameters but main board died suddenly without any sign of distress ( night we shutdown and in the morning it was not booting completely died) after 1 year 3 months but luckily I was having onsiteGo extended warranty.It costed 46k to onsiteGo (as they declared) and rs 1700 to us at apple authorised service center for diagnosis.If reliability is improved it will be master piece.The above is not stray incidence, as many complaints are there on internetUpdate 25.07.2019Again it stopped booting, now there is no warranty, taken to multi lap top service center, they repaired logic board (it is motherboard ) by  introcing some fine cables from one chip to another and billed 16k (further they informed me tha the on-siteGo didn't replace mother board but repaired , contrary to their claim), but I was not confident. hence I have  exchanged it with lenovo and got an Exhange value of 13k"
1759,5.0 stars,"  Best laptop to work on and carry around. Easy to use, travel friendly, just a bit overpriced but not overhyped at all. I'm really happy with my Mac ‚ù§Ô∏è"
1760,5.0 stars,"  PLEASE NOTE- I bought the MacBook from a certified retail store.This MacBook Air is still the cheapest MacBook out there. Though it is pretty old, it still works just fine. And all Apple devices last much longer than other non-apple devices. Especially if you're a student, this is the perfect laptop for you. Though it might start lagging a few times, as though the hardware is new, it's not the best one. The battery is just excellent.The main reason I got this laptop was for some light editing and writing. And the keyboard is amazing (some of you might say that other laptops have much better keyboards). Editing is very easy and smooth on this laptop, as it runs most of the latest software perfectly, including a few of the graphics engines. It is perfect for studying and also works as a decent laptop for work. Though, editing long videos in 4K may cause the laptop to lag.But, the storage capacity is a big problem. You see, I edit a lot of 4K videos on this laptop, and even rendering takes up a lot of space, and I end up removing a lot of applications. So, it's better to upgrade the storage. But because of the great SSD, booting times are WAY better than my previous Windows laptop.Also, the camera is bad, but ports are great (all essential ports included, except ethernet, serial etc. and optical drive).So, if you really want to use a laptop's capability to the fullest, this may not be the one. The sole purpose of a Macintosh computer is to remove all the complications that we face with other laptops and to make a terrific computer that anyone could buy without doubting. Whenever one has to buy a computer, instead of comparing thousands of computers, they could just get a Macintosh, knowing that it won't let them down.Fixing a MacBook is even better. As you just need to take your MacBook, and a payment method, to an Apple Store, and after a few days, you'll have your laptop, running just like a new one. Everything about a MacBook is simple, thus making it the appropriate choice for students.And every Apple user will not comment on your MacBook when it'll be obsolete. Apple themselves say that every Apple product is to be used for long, then passed down to another person, and used until it becomes completely unusable, after which it is recycled to serve millions of other Apple users.So, if you want a complicated, but very powerful and customizable computer, then the Mac is not the one. But, if you want to get a reliable, simple, and sophisticated laptop that will provide you with sufficient power to do numerous tasks, without using complicated algorithms, and performing every task in a very simple way, the MacBook will be a great investment."
1761,2.0 stars,  Battery is draining out very quickly after 2-3 hours of usage. Also it's not lasting for more than 7 days once it's in a sleep mode.Not at all recommend.
1762,1.0 stars,  Battery issue with the laptop. Doesn't give backup as expected . Really upset with the product.
1763,5.0 stars,"  Best laptop for developers. Its linux based, its safe and every software works so fast due to ssd. Premium quality. Cons- screen quality and little space but I have 2Tb externel Hard disk so I dont have that problem other than that its worth it. x code, android studio, sublime text, intellij, photoshop, sketch, postman works all fine. Its not for gaming though."
1764,1.0 stars,"  its 2020 and i dono y they are selling this outdated machine in this price anymore. . people pls stop buying this. the machine was excellent for its time, but its not worth anymore."
1765,1.0 stars,"  I bought this macbook as my first experience with Apple laptop products. It worked absolutely fine for the first year which I sparingly used. I didnt use the laptop much in the 2nd year but surprisingly the laptop stopped turning on due to some internal problem as confirmed by their technicians. After much research and reading online, I gathered that Apple MacAir has serious issues since it's built very differently than thr the other laptops. Many parts are not repairable but are replace because of the design constraints. Basically, there is a general consensus in the buyer community that MacAir is a hit anand miss product and that the buyers should know about this before they buy. I was completely unaware of this when I bought this and no wonder Apple has stopped making these products. Interestingly enough, Apple wouldn't replace or refund or even offer me a buyback for their blunder. I was told I was one of the lucky ones since these things happen only one out of every 1000 devices they make and they said this is ""quite common"" with any other company. I was not given any option or recourse. I was told that I have the rights to pursue any legal action against them and that they were prepared for any such actions.Overall, this experience has left a bad taste about Apple as a company. I thought they were known for quality products and service and I've learnt from this experience that this is not true. I have taken a pledge to make sure that I will never buy an Apple product in my life ever again as this is the only way I can get back at them."
1766,5.0 stars,"  Amazing product by Apple,awesome build quality.10 times quick then windows laptops.got a nice deal paid 43k"
1767,2.0 stars,  Electric vibrations/mild shocks when its charging and i touch its body. Please help me find out how to solve it :(Its screen blinks as well. Im worried
1768,4.0 stars,"  The Macbook Air is an uber cool & super sassy investment. The 3 best aspects about the Macbook Air - 1, Battery life is amazing to say the least. Most laptops I have used till date had a substandard battery life but this is gold. 2, Macbook air is v classy looking. I love the silver color. I also have an Imac and that obviously surpasses in terms of performance, but transporting it was a pain. 3, Laptops are of course portable, but this fits like a dream anywhere since it‚Äôs v thin & light - just buy a laptop sleeve and you‚Äôre set.Performance wise I needed it for djing too, where I have heard macbook pro is better, but I hope I can manage for starters with this. PS I needed it for office work at the moment for which it is excellent and I was sold by it‚Äôs battery life & look, both of which are better than MBP. Yeah yeah, I know MBP performance is better but this is love."
1769,1.0 stars,"  I bought it one year ago with the expectation of getting quality and performance over time along with my friend who also bought at the same time. Within a year it started giving problems. The service centre people just charged hefty amounts without fixing it in kormangla, bangalore. Customer care people made false diplomatic promises and did nothing . My friend also faced same that means they have some manufacturing defects. Event after spending about 1 lakh , we dont have laptop that we can reply on. Whatever I heard about apple was fake. Apple is no great. In same range go for windows laptop with better configuration and no manufacturing defects."
1770,5.0 stars,"  I bought it 3moth back, for learning Sketcapp. It's worth in all aspect- performance, battery life and display. I only disappointed with the storage device. Its come with 128GB Hard Disk Size. But overall perfect till now."
1771,5.0 stars,"  Moving from windows to mac was a hard choice , personally i have never used an apple product , its so good for the price that its available on amazon...its a steal, i would only recommend this only to light users , any kind of heavy editing or designing i don't think the air would stand up to your demands , if you're looking for a laptop around 50k , don't choose a windows laptop over the air because of the specs , the mac os works totally different than that of windows , its light , durable , the build quality is excellent.BUY THIS!!!"
1772,1.0 stars,  Having updation problem....
1773,5.0 stars,"  It's barely been a week since I've been using it but super battery life, works real fast, smooth blah blah. Yes the storage is low - this just means: don't store un-required files and use an external hard drive. If you take good care of it, it's a rewarding machine to use. Buy during a sale - it's good value for money."
1774,5.0 stars,"  I thought it would be so difficult moving from a Windows OS to a Mac OS laptop. I always had in mind I should get a MacBook someday considering how my uncles and cousins keep raving about it but somehow never took the plunge. But when Amazon had an amazing offer on the MacBook Air that too the latest model, for a USD equivalent of 700, I didn't have a reason anymore to not take the plunge.Contrary to what I thought, it was quite easy to get going. It was so much faster to setup the MacBook than any Windows laptop that I have ever bought. A quick search on google and Quora about how to get started on a Mac for a forever Windows user and some keyboard shortcuts and cheat sheets for Mac beginners, I was up and running like a pro within a couple of days.Now I'm so used to the speed at which I can browse websites, switch apps, forget about ever shutting down the system (I just close the lid), that when I go back to using my windows laptop, I feel it is so primitively slow. Overall an excellent buy, just go for it with eyes closed if you are ever on the edge of whether to take the plunge."
1775,5.0 stars,"  Bought it during big billion sale Sept 2017 for 45k!!Thanks to Amazon for giving out this for such lower price and for on-time delivery.Needless to say about the quality, features and beauty of Apple's Macbook.. Awesome product!!"
1776,5.0 stars,"  I don't have words to describe it. simply amazing. Delivered before time, was packaged very safely. Today being Sunday I had few problems to get the package but satisfied in the end."
1777,5.0 stars,"  Form is temporary but class is permanent. Probably that's the most accurate line for this MacBook. Recently I've bought MacBook Air 2019 version from an apple store. I know what others are saying about screen and backdated specs that these are pretty less compared to other windows laptop. True. But in words. All the shortcomings are overpowered excellently by Mac Catalina. What an amazing OS! You will not notice any fault in this MacBook. It's a gem that never loses its value. If I talk about the Pros and Cons like many others here, it would be meaningless. Before buying that MacBook I read many reviews and watched many videos online, the cons made me utterly confused. I couldn't decide whether to buy this one or not. Finally I dared and settled my mind to go for it. Trust me, I'm not regretting at all. Battery, Performance, Screen quality and that Feel will give you no time to regret over your choice. In simple words, be in zero doubt and buy this one. Just one point, this laptop is not for the gamers as you know apple doesn't make gaming laptop at all in real words. Especially this one is for the professional people like writer, youtube video editor, office workers etc. In my opinion, mature content for the mature people who wanna spend not more than 60-65k."
1778,5.0 stars,"  excellent As expected,ultimate product at this pricei am using this for software developmentsi am using Android studio , X code at the same time and no lagging performance good"
1779,5.0 stars,  Just perfect! I am loving my new MacBook. Got it during Prime Day sale at a reasonable price from Apacio retail. Thanks!!
1780,3.0 stars,  Delivery was fast. The only problem I faced with this MacBook is that there is some oily permanent mark on the screen that only shows once the PC is off! Otherwise no complaint. I was too lazy to make an exchange but it feels like this product hasn't been packed with care.
1781,1.0 stars,  GST no. and Company Name Not mentioned on Invoice.
1782,4.0 stars,"  With seamless sync and handoff with my iphone working has become so easy. I can receive sms/ OTPs directly filled up as well as make & receive calls directly from macbook air via my iphone asit remains at some corner, charging up. copy a text on mobile and paste it on mac... taking photos from mobile to mac desktop directly and so many such connected features!!! Plus the awesome multi window, icloud integration, unlimited battery back-up, sleek, light weight. Overall no-nonsense. Bought in early 2018. Cons - storage but with my 300mbps airtel broadband and seamless icloud & office 365 everything is breeze."
1783,5.0 stars,"  Awesome Product, Sleek and Slim, Fast Speed Low Weight, Best Buy in 43500 with deal. Shopping on Amazon is Awesome :)"
1784,5.0 stars,  Awesome battery life. Awesome finishing. Very lightweight. You can do gaming if you find mac compatible games. Very nice and loud speakers. Awesome trackpad. Very nice keyboard. It takes very less time to render video using Imovie software. Very good for apps developer no issues with xcode.  It is so good that you will rarely like any other laptop.The only drawback is less storage space for which you can use its memory card slot. Using this from 2016 and this is full paisa vasul laptop. Just handle with care repairs can cost you a lot.
1785,1.0 stars,  I bought such an expensive laptop(same model) thinking it will last upto 5 years. The laptop suddenly stopped turning on one fine day! When I took it to various apple approved service centers and iplanets they simply said motherboard has to be changed and it will cost rupees 45K+ ! Over and above they charge 2000 bucks just to check and tell this. This laptop in particular will not be serviced by laptop in the near future as it is an old model. Buyers please put your money in a high end windows laptop for the same money. Atleast there are tons of people who can repair in case of any problem. Dont get lured by the glitter!
1786,4.0 stars,  product is really good as expected but the delivery was bit delayed otherwise its good.
1787,1.0 stars,  THEY ARE SELLING 5th GENERATION Intel i3 Processor at a price of around ‚Çπ68000...Apple has gone mad... PLEASE Don't buy and support them.. When in today's World 8th GENERATION Intel i3 processors are available at a price point of below ‚Çπ30000 then who in the hell will buy such a outdated Laptop by paying around ‚Çπ68000...APPLE thinks we INDIANS are morons...
1788,4.0 stars,  Works great. Recently it has started to heat up and the it doesn't charge until put in a specific position. Didn't expect that with apple. But oh well.
1789,2.0 stars,  MS office crashes all the time and stupid trackpad stops clicking when you most need it and then even external mouse doesn't help and there is nothing you can do about it except find another laptop in middle of work/ study
1790,5.0 stars,"  I have used both the Dell XPS and MacBook , and if you dont know Dell XPS is a premium  laptop and every time I want to comeback to my Mac as everything is so simple and elegant. The question you need to ask yourself before buying this laptop is that if you want to do random things such as changing the mouse cursor or game a lot etc. If you want a laptop that works for 9/10 cases and that 1 case being gaming then go for it. Going from windows to Mac takes time but it is worth it. The stability you get is mind blowing and you won't regret spending the money. When it comes to a laptop its not just about the performance, everything adds up- The battery life, the ui stability etc."

1797,3.0 stars,"  The pros and cons of MAC,Pros:great displayThinLightSmoothCons1)If you want performance forget it. This is age old hardware they sell at the price of new one you will get better hardware at the same price or even lesser.2) if you are going for 3d model or animation kind of stuff plz dont buy this.3) Gaming: bro sorry to say but you are going for wrong choice.4) it will become a useless object as soon as apple ends the support.5) not upgradable (RAM AND STORAGE)6) spareparts are not available.ConclusionIf you want great display simply buy itElse invest it on a better product"
1798,5.0 stars,"  Excellent for students and business professionals.I am a mac user since 2007 and I purchased my MackBook air is 2012 and used it for four years without any issue. Compared to windows and linux laptop, this machine is very light and functional. When I say functional it means that when you press power button it just starts and is ready to use every time within minutes. It is not like windows where before every restart there would be a update for 20 minutes and every now and then failures.This machine just works every time and very light and goes for more than 7 hours non stop without charger. It has track pad much much better than any windows machine on market. You can blindly purchase this machine although the configuration may look inferior or outdated but you will not regret buying this..!I am just writing pro and con's for this machine from my experiencePro:1) Very light weight and handy2) Battery life is superb !3) No issue of virus.4) Just ok screen resolution.5) Track pad is excellent.6) Sound quality is also good7) WiFi is excellent8) Hard drive/SSD is fast..9) Media card reader built in the laptop.10) Charger is very small11) Warranty/Customer support is excellent12) Aluminium build quality is very good13) Very good battery lifeCon:1) Screen is not an HD screen but you don't need for work. (Just good enough for your regular browsing and office work.)2) Not upgradable.3) Outdated configuration when compared to current generation laptops4) Can't play heavy weight games on this machine because of ultra low power intel CPU and no extra graphics card.5) You can't run numerical simulations but you can definitely do programing/ compilation.6) Repair is extremely costly7) No CD drive although not requiredEven after so many negative points I definitely recommend this machine to my friend. Two of my friends bought on my recommendation and they are happy! There is no other laptop in market that works every time when you need it!"

1801,4.0 stars,"  Hello, First of all, I am not a frequent reviewer but I had to write this after buying a 50k machine which I always wanted to own.This review is all about who should buy it and who shouldn't.Who Should:I believe MBA's and management people and anybody who is looking for a powerful machine to browse websites all day, make presentations and docs on the go, would absolutely love the fluidity, power and its battery backup. You would absolutely adore the gestures on its super-duper amazing trackpad. Install a MS-Word system and you would thank me if you buy the system after reading this review. ;)Who Should NOT:Engineers apart from specific ones (the ios devs). I bought the machine for the coding and daily RnD's and, let me tell you, to install any software is a task in its own. I am an engineer working on data science projects and love to explore any thing that comes out in tech just like every other passionate engineer, but, after 2 months, I feel like I invested my money in the wrong machine. Every day something new comes up and I find myself googling stuffs like 'install libraries FOR MAC', 'access root FOR MAC' or even, 'how to cut paste IN MAC' (believe me you would do this too!). It lacks GPU and you would feel it after running a heavy duty code. You would need to install softwares for basic stuff like connecting an android device (oh yes! feel terrible already?), connecting your hard-disks formatted in NTPC and etc etc. I can be wrong here for people working on specific tools and libraries but when it comes to generalise, I would be right. Mac is an amazing piece when it comes to basic stuff. Trackpad, the keys and the classy lightweight body are the features NOT ALL companies provide but IT LACKS BASICS for software development and RnD. I hope it saves someone's hard earned money! Peace!"
1802,4.0 stars,"  If you just do office work and light gaming then this is the computer for you, its a steal at 56-58k has over 9 hours of battery life on light use.Has 2 usd ports so no need for extra dongles, at present the best MacBook in market though screen resolution is not as good as newer models but the keyboard is better than then butterfly"

1809,5.0 stars,"  I live in Hyderabad. I have bought it on Amazon on 16 August 2017. I am giving review on 21 September 2018. More than a year, there is NO problem at all. First things first. The delivery was perfect. Packed very well. I was worried initially to order such costly stuff online. I was worried if it will be duplicate product. But, Amazon has put away all my worries. I got MacBook Air 2017 model at Rs.59,990/- which is even the best deal after a year. I am a Graphic Designer and use powerful tools like Adobe Illustrator. It delivers a very good performance. I love the battery life. And, it also charges super fast. I love my MacBook Air. :-)"
1810,5.0 stars,"  Bought the new MacBook Air 2017 model (released in mid 2017) from Cloutail India. Fast delivery and amazing packaging. It's my first mac. It's amazing and fast! Battery life is superb, but hasn't lived up to its 14 hour claim yet so I think mine might be faulty. Charging time isn't amazingly short. Very easy to set up and get used to. Beautiful. Worth the money."
1811,5.0 stars,  will buy for 51k
1812,5.0 stars,"  The promotion is very misleading.There in the description, you can see finger print unlock, however ther is no such feature you can find on this model.Is it still ok to keep promoting in this way?I hope Amozon can be a platform where any customer can purchase products without any worry."
1813,4.0 stars,"  I have been a mac user since 2012, I was using MBP mid 2012 until I messed up its logic board during some experimentation.I was confused as most of the people with this budget would be to choose a windows laptop with better hardware or choose this aged hardware over the windows. There are very good options in 55-65k budget from Asus/Lenovo/Hp/Dell.What made me choose MacOS again was the ECOSYSTEM, yes that‚Äôs right the whole apple ecosystem plays a significant role in deciding whether you really need this or not. I have an iPhone, iPad, apple watch and everything is so seamlessly integrated with each other that it just makes everything so easier. I can unlock my mac with my watch. Once I login with my Apple ID everything gets synchronised within my devices including my passwords etc.I have booted windows on this laptop using bootcamp and I have no issues running it.Apple products just complement each other really well. I did not had the budget to buy one of the latest model‚Äôs so I decided to stick with MacOS by buying this. FYI, apple discontinued this laptop in international markets in 2018 but is still the best selling laptops here in 2020.The build quality is exceptionally well, you will not get any windows laptop built this well except for XPS (Dell) or the Surface Book (Microsoft) and they cost a fortune! Just like the latest MacBook Pro line-up.The screen is awful for content consuming, watching Netflix etc etc.See the attached image the right side of the image is completely blown out. ( image form iPhone 11 pro max believe me the screen is horrible, image is good :P )Performance is exceptionally good considering the dated 5th gen dual core chip and much much slower DDR3 1600 MHz ram. In the age of 10th gen and DDR4x ram‚Äôs. but meh. It just numbers for the geeks, in real world you would not notice lag in daily tasks macOS is extremely smooth it can handle day to day task creating docs surfing web and watching movies it will give you at least 8hrs of battery life with mixed usage.This belongs to you if you are already in apple ecosystem or if you want to shift into it. Please consider this decision again because the saying ‚ÄúOnce an apple user is always an apple user‚Äù  is TRUE.If you are an average user this laptop should still last you for good 5 years. My last MacBook lasted me 8 years :)"
1814,1.0 stars,  Extremely unreliable. Worked alright for 1 year and 3 months and then just died suddenly. Now it's out of warranty and service center people are asking to replace the logic board. They don't have any explanation for what caused this. This reflects the cheap quality that Apple is peddling these days.There are much better laptops with lesser price. Don't go after the Apple brand.
1815,5.0 stars,  I don't know why people are giving single star. Yeah it doesn't have USB C. It has two USB 3.0. The difference between 2015 and 2017 model is that this has a processor with clock speed 1.8GHz and turbo boost up to 2.9GHz.
1816,1.0 stars,"  after using 2/3 days it starts falling down, OS got crashed and there is a question mark on the screen.Please don't buy anything on portal only those which are more special for your, as this was my first dream to take but now can see that should not buy this expensive items from Amazon specially or from other portal as well."
1817,5.0 stars,  Go for 1.8 GHz 2017 version. If you are spending little more is not a big deal.speed difference of almost 12%. 1.6 to 1.8Ghz. That's all Rest every thing is same from body to Ram. Battery life outstanding performance good.
1818,5.0 stars,  Best buy I've made till date.. Perfect for blogging and 1080p video editing. Mac OS for me like crazy.. It's integrated in such a way that you can do anything with amazing fluidity.. I'm damn sure ; My next laptop is going to be an Apple product.
1819,5.0 stars,"  Even though this Mac runs on i5, yet the best and the smoothest laptop ever!! There‚Äôs literally no chance of getting annoyed of being stuck in the middle of your work load, which normally happens in other laptops. The disadvantage can be the space limit, although you can use hard drive for that. The webcam is Legit awesome, good for business video calling , better those normal smartphone cameras."
1820,1.0 stars,  I cannot fathom why one would go for a less than mediocre product like this and for this price. Typing from my phone that has double the Ram and double the memory. Ok enough said.
1821,5.0 stars,  On time delivery and genuine product received!!!
1822,1.0 stars,  You should not buy this laptop..instead of these you buy a windows laptop..I only one year i have to visit service centre around 5 to 6 times..even if the problem is not resolved..first time motherboard is damaged..then battery panel..then speaker and problem with the battery..so if you are planning to buy a macbook air then you don't buy it

1825,5.0 stars,"  When you have a budget of 50-60k, this is the laptop you wanna buy. This laptop is intended for personal use and it delivers that with no setbacks. If you want a laptop for gaming or 4k heavy video editing, then this laptop is not for you, look for MacBook Pro or iMac."
1826,5.0 stars,"  I've been using Air from 2015 December. Never had any trouble. Feels like new even to this day. Ideal for travelers, students, movie lovers. I run MATLAB/Simulink on Air. Had no problems. I've come to understand what the term ""customer satisfaction""means after I've started using Air. Have installed Boom 3D audio enhancer. Now the sound is just amazing! Apple Macbook Air is has a special role and place in the freedom I get to experience!"
1827,5.0 stars,"  Smooth as butter, if you are concer about the display, don't worry it's awesome even if it's not a retina display. Excellent battery backup. In love seriously in love with this beauty.. Just keep it clean. Damn it's awesome. ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è"

1834,5.0 stars,"  Macintosh has come a long way since its inception back in 1984 and continues to delight us with its innovation mixed with futurist thinking. This 2017 version of MacBook is basically an ‚Äòold wine in a new bottle‚Äô getting a minimal increase of 0.2 GHz in processor speed over the 2015 version. Despite having negligible changes, MacBook Air 2017 remains the best choice for the Indian masses.::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  Why a MacBook Air?  ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::Anyone trying to get their hands on this sleek beauty should definitely ask this question to themselves. Only after getting satisfactory answers, should they go forward to even ‚Äòthink‚Äô of owning it.If you are into playing high graphics games, fancies in having terabytes of movies as a collection or gets pleasure in listening to loud music minus headphones, this device is definitely not for you to wish upon.However, if you are a frequent traveller, interested in neck-breathing performance coupled with really long battery life and is conscious of fashion etiquettes, this product is a must buy.::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  Positives  ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::1) Sleek and Ergonomic Design  --  MacBook Air is a piece of silvery beast, ergonomically designed to appeal your senses, simultaneously making a fashion statement.2) Quite Lightweight  --  MacBook Air justifies its name, feels very light and hence much portable.3) Excellent Backup  --  Apple has definitely amazed me with the battery backup of the device which touches 11 hours on full charge. Additionally, if you leave it on sleep mode for a couple of days, it will hardly deplete even 2% each day. Don‚Äôt believe me? Try it out!4) Lightning Fast Booting  --  The device boots itself in approximately 3 seconds and takes hardly 4 seconds to shut down.5) Sugarcoated with Solid State Drive  --  Since this device used Solid State Drive (SSD) as its storage medium; it is not only super fast but also extremely quiet.6) Fast MagSafe Charger  --  Well, the Air comes with MagSafe 2, a magnetic connector which attracts your charging inlet when taken near it. The charger charges the Air from 0 to 100 percent in less than 90 minutes, which is damn fast.7) Noise Less Front Camera  --  The camera it possesses is practically noise free and can impart exceptional picture even in low lighting conditions.8) Ambient Light Sensors  --  As all of you might have known, MacBook comes with keypad lightning, not to mention the backlit Apple logo. All of these are sensor enables and thus adjusts according to the lighting conditions.9) Ample Key Spacing  --  Apple packs a well designed keyboard in a 13.3 inch laptop giving ample amount of space between the keys and this is what I call an engineering marvel.10) Mac OS  --  The presence of Mac OS is solely enough to own a MacBook, taking into factor the OS‚Äôs multi-level security, super stability, attractive GUI, virtually driver-less experience and its ability to recognise any Apple products. Additionally, having a personal assistant in name of Siri does not hurt anyone.::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  Negatives  ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::1) Screen Resolution  --  Air is packed with LED backlit glossy display of resolution of 1440 x 900 pixels (HD Ready) with 128ppi. Not owning a laptop with at least a Full HD resolution in 2017 is surely a setback.2) No Dedicated Graphics  --  Nowadays, even basic games in the market requires a dedicated graphics and not having it clearly dismisses playing any game in this beastly device.3) Lower Bass  --  Although the device outputs good quality audio, there is a certain lack of bass being felt, which, in my opinion, could have been easily taken care of.After going through the pros and cons above, I am of the opinion that the decision making of yours will certainly be more definite. Also, be sure to look out for offers in Amazon as I got this device as low as 45K.::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  A Kind Request  ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::Many of you have messaged me on Facebook asking either about the offer or about the device in details.I request anyone requiring any further help to kindly comment below this review or email me (found on my profile bio) as all your messages on facebook were in the 'Message Request' section and I did not get any notification for the same.If you are not comfortable publicly discussing, at least comment here saying 'Check your Facebook' or likewise so that I get aware of your willingness to reach me.Apologies to all who could not get my reply on time; it was unintentional."
1835,1.0 stars,  Very disappointed...the laptop started getting rebooted after every few minutes. One month after purchase when the return time period had expired. Took it to Apple certified shop 4 times every time they said it is repaired but still the same have given it at the store 5th time today.can Amazon help ?
1836,5.0 stars,  Awesome product. Love it.Got as a gift.First time Mac user.havenot not felt much difference.Amazing I also have a brand new T480 office laptop.if I compare.This product isCheaper.Super fast.No sound.No heat.TThe most distinctive features wasTouch pad. WowDisplay. Your eyes will not strain even after hours.Just close and open to use laptop with not even a sec delay.Overall I am.very happy to own this.
1837,1.0 stars,  I have ordered Mac Air on 23 June and On 1st July is received the product....while switch on the product software was not responding...while I tried to restart...restart option was not working and anyways it was choosing shut down option...After spending more than 50K if you such product its better to not to buy..interesting thing is as per customer support these products are already tested....Advice the buyers to think before you buy from Amazon.I never expected from Amazon or Apple. Sorry but I am really disappointed with the product.
1838,1.0 stars,"  After i pur hased the device within 10 days amazon lowered the proce by 12,000 n there wass no intrest emi option as well but at the time i purchased it there was no such optionSo i am very disappointed"
1839,1.0 stars,  The mac book delivered is not at all working this is not expected from such a reputed brand .looking for an immediate replacement or return.Very urgent
1840,1.0 stars,"  It's late 2018 and I don't know why people still buy this. You have a lot of other options  in this segment. Only nice thing about this is it's battery life but then why compromise on the performance and other features in newer laptops. Oh yes this shit is exceptionally built and that's the reason why Apple has been selling it for quite some time without giving it an update. Yeah they did update it recently and then everything comes at a price and it's no longer affordable. And the worst, they increased the price of the older model. Apple thinks that people are dumb enough to buy their product even if it's good as turd in this period of time."
1841,2.0 stars,  I've used a MacBook air before (2013 or 2014 version) and never had any.problem with it overheating while working. But this BRAND NEW MacBook is overheating when I use iMovie to edit. I know this isn't normal because it hasn't happened in my older MacBook. Anyone else having these issues? I'm thinking of returning it cause  more than half a lakh is too much money to pay for a laptop that is constantly overheating.
1842,4.0 stars,"  Buying it in 2018 above 50,000/- INR , many reviewers would say no as this machine still does not have the standard display but I wanted one and went ahead and bought it because:1. As said I wanted Mac and this was the biggest factor2. MBPs are still costing double in India of Air3. The laptop built is solid, light weight and it is still very fast despite of running older Intel processor4. Battery backup is amazing,now I don't have to carry charger when I go outside for full day5. Wanted to wait for updates on Mac lineup 2018 but then thought even if that happens you won't get the machine under 60,000(that would cost around 80-90K minimum)6. Best of programming, learning, entertainment and document worksCONS after 1 month of use:1. No Full HD display2. Large bezels on screen3. Keyboard does not feel great if you are a regular user of newer MBP(I have one from work)Overall I can say that this machine is definitely great but little overpriced(in India) and if you want the Mac experience then this is the right option for you."
1843,5.0 stars,"  Switching from WINDOWS to MAC for the first time. Some of the applications I use are compatible only with IE and Mac doesnt have IE and I didnt find a way out yet. Thats bit of disappointing.Memory is less and even out of 128GB, only 60 GB is usable..rest all goes to OS and system files. Compromised on this for the Brand and performance is so far so good."
1844,1.0 stars,"  Dont buy this product. Product is not worth it. I had read all the reviews saying Apple is apple and  it never crashes/hangs and bought it. I have seen it crash, hang and heating. Battery life is good. It's worth buying some other make products which would give better performance and value for your hard earned money, with the equivalent amount. If you haven't earned your money then definitely to just showoff you can buy this.Pros: Good battery, will work for the day.Cons: Not for performance user, heats and hangs sometimes. Software compatibility will be issue with the latest OS Mojave."
1845,1.0 stars,  Ok.... Apple and it's op laptops.... Or should I say products... A dammm costly laptop with 8gigs Or ram nd just an ssd???? Nd it ships with a core i5 5th gen...

This bloody thing doesn't even have a hard drive 128gigs ssd is like using a 64 gig sd card on ur phone.... Pay extra for new ssd or a hard drive after all this... Come on
1846,2.0 stars,  this price is so high for this laptop. please drop this price by 35%to 37% because this is the 2017 model and for that this price is not reasonable in 2020
1847,5.0 stars,"  Bought it from Amazon. Using it for almost 1.5 years. This laptop is perfect for light users. I use Photoshop, Lightroom and they run so smoothly that you would be amazed (yes, more smoothly than 70-80k nvidia windows laptops). Battery backup is superb ( almost 6 hrs in normal usage). It's a pleasure to use this laptop. Those who are worrying about less number of free softwares for mac, trust me, here less is more. It's light, sleek and fast. Leave the lag behind. Once you start using Mac, you will never go back to windows. However, this laptop is not for gaming."
1848,5.0 stars,  Awesome battery backup..... I can't even think that how a that much slim laptop don't heat even after 8 hours of continuous work....... I am a college student and is best except for games....... U will never use any other  laptop after using it...... ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
1849,3.0 stars,  This macbook is good for daily use like watching movies listening to music  or internet surfing. It will not handle heavy task like video editing etc. operating system is stable but you will not find application range like windows. Battery is good for first 4 5 days after it is giving me maximum 4 hours battery for internet surfing and 3 hours on netflix. Buy it if you want to use apple product or want introduction to mac. but you can buy better windows laptop at same price.
1850,2.0 stars,"  I use mac professionally, from my technical skills, i suggest the seller to stop selling this old product since it is now(2020) can be used as a download box only, i recommend mac buyers to look for newer models, they are costlier but perform better."
1851,1.0 stars,"  Apple sells outdated hardware at a premium price just for its branding. They are still selling a laptop with 5th gen core i5 processor for well over ‚Çπ66000. All other manufacturers have already moved on to 7th and 8th generation processors. RAM in macbook is soldiered- no option to upgrade! The SSD uses proprietary connector and not the NVMe SSDs used by other laptops- so that can‚Äôt be upgraded easily too. Also these devices are not for any gaming use at all- 1- lack of any decent games on mac os, 2- lack of any ventilation ports on the apple toasters! U load a processor intensive application and u ll hear the fan struggling to cool the device at peak rpm."
1852,5.0 stars,"  this is by far the best laptop ever used under this price point (I bought it at 60k around a year ago). does all the day to day tasks seamlessly. no issues at all.BATTERY LIFEif u r some one who needs the most amount of juice to last whole day then this is the go for it solution. no laptop under or even above this price point can't give this amount of battery life. I usually use for referring videos, reading pdfs writing notes, some light video editing and it handles it all with ease."
1853,5.0 stars,"  If you want a laptop which is super portable and has a super duper battery life then just go for  it , this is the best laptopyou can get no laptop in the market which offers a 12 hour battery backup .....And also if you are no into gaming and all that kind of stuff then macbook air is best option for youfor programmers also this is best but i suggest you to go for 256 gb variant as 128 might not be a good choice for youor you just buy a 128 gb variant and use a external hard drive .......Thank you"

1855,5.0 stars,  Awesome and after using it I believe that once a Mac always a Mac. Loving it.
1856,3.0 stars,"  This is definitely a good buy in 2019 but every machine has it‚Äôs pros and cons.PRO‚Äôs:‚Ä¢It has the same configuration of the new 2018 MacBook Air, apart from the Flash Drive.‚Ä¢ It‚Äôs a powerful machine that can operate processor intensive softwares with minimum breakdown.‚Ä¢Lightweight and upgradable to OS Mojave. There‚Äôs no point spending around 50k more for almost same processor and performance at entry level MacBook, if it‚Äôs not for professional usage.CONS:‚Ä¢ It‚Äôs biggest setback is the non Retina display which does not represent true colours and does hurt the eye after prolonged use. The bezels are too in the face.‚Ä¢ 128 gb is a low for heavy usage but external drive can be attached and it works fine."

1861,5.0 stars,"  This is the best laptop money can buy at this price. I bought it from a different seller but thought of leaving a review here for other buyers. From photo editing, to designing mobile apps to day to day work - it handles everything with ease. The size is super comfortable to carry and hardly has any weight. Got it at a lesser price then what it is selling for now."

1868,1.0 stars,"  This is an old model (2018) which was launched with 51k, but even after 2 years (2020) the price is 63k. I think Apple or Amazon's Vendor is fooling us. Please don't buy this old laptop and fall into their trap."

It has 6 Li cells, so battery backup is best. 8GB ram provides the best usage of applications, and MS OFFICE edition is supported"
1875,3.0 stars,"  Update: Amazon/Cloudtail replaced the faulty Mac with new laptop and it is working fine. Thanks for great customer service by Amazon.Thanks Amazon for delivering in time. The laptop booted well in the first time, then onward (same day), it stopped working (not booting to the OS). I called Apple's customer care and after countless hours with Apple's service agent over phone, they concluded that the hardware is faulty. I immediately requested Amazon for the replacement. Now waiting for the replacement. Interestingly, Apple claimed that Amazon is not official partner of Apple to sale MacBook or iPad. They also claimed that there might be internal hardware damage due to mishandling at Amazon's warehouse. I am really baffled with Apple's response."

1881,5.0 stars,"  It is the cheapest apple laptop, but it's performance is still better than most windows laptops. It can do coding, web browsing, writing easily. However, if you are into gaming then you should look for a better model. Nevertheless, it's great. I've been using it for over 9 months now, and I must have switched it off properly hardly 15 to 20 times, and it still works perfectly. I can say with certainty that this laptop will serve me efficiently for well over three years more."
1882,5.0 stars,  This is best laptop for coding 8 hour + battery and it can handle IOS emulator very well.But Android studio emulator will lag.If Coding is your passion then i would rate this cheapest and best performing laptop.

1889,4.0 stars,"  Apple has closed all the local stores including its own chain stores and increased the price. I got macbook in 44k with HDFC cash back offer, now the same macbook is being sold at a premium of Rs. 20k. Thus Looting the Customers."
1890,1.0 stars,  don't buy apple product they have a serious problem in their logic board after 1 year & 2 month when warrenty period finised my mac suddendly dead when i taken it to service center they are not skilled to repair board they wanted to replace logic board which cost more than 47000 (prce of the laptop) so please dont invest your hard earned money in apple. buy anything but dont buy apple. cheater company looting the common peoples.
1891,5.0 stars,"  Very fast, but storage you have to manage in cloud or in external hdd. Also the screen is not full hd though has been set with pretty decent color contrast and brightness. Very very light weight and has an amazing premium look and feel. Screen is 13.3 inch. Mousepad is awesome. Keyboard is smooth. I use it for reading and writing and sometimes watching movies and listening to music. Great for my work. Not for people interested in gaming or high end processing work. This is my first time experience with mac and had some inhibitions about using a different os ever than windows but it was grwat fun to adapt to mac and happened with lot of ease. Music is decently good enough. Best of the best is battery backup like a 12 hours and writing this after a week's use. Very light weight. I just love it. And the price. Csnt imagine a macbook at this price range."
1892,4.0 stars,"  Works as advertised, comfortable to use .It is so thin and tapering in the front that I have get used to opening it. Now, I know why MagSafe is liked so much. Free software iWorks takes care of the office part. Be minimalistic and don't transfer or download unnecessary files or softwares. There is not much space - after all the updated etc you will be left with 90GB or so.Wireless connection is easy and consistent.AirDrop works with newer iPhones.After 13 months, just after a month of expired warranty, the Display adapter malfunctioned- now apple says I need to pay Rs 45000 only for a full logic board change !!Crap üí©"

1899,5.0 stars,"  No Can beat Apple in the price range of 40-70k in terms of performance from battery backup, OS, processing, easy to carry, durability or whatever you talk about. I have been a big critic of apple phones because I don't see the value after investing so much money but Apple laptops are worth spending. I bought 1 and a half years ago at 64k and till now never encountered any problem at all, Moroever battery backup is still 10-10.5 hours after once fully charged."

1905,1.0 stars,  Charger be as hot as burning!
1906,5.0 stars,"  Hey guys, if you are thinking of purchasing the MacBook Air, chances are that you already know it's best for you but if you wanna know some extra stuff, it's here. Just pay a look and you'll be glad you did.Let's get on with it.=====PROS=====-Excellent battery life.-Fast storage.-Great Keyboard.=====CONS=====-Dated design.-Display.-Speakers.Two years and three processor generations later, Apple is selling what is essentially the 2015 MacBook Air with ever-so-slightly closer to 2017 components inside.The 12-inch MacBook, as well as the 13- and 15-inch MacBook Pros were all refreshed earlier this year, complete with more up-to-date Intel Kaby Lake processors, yet notably the MacBook Air only received a minor processor clock boost. It certainly makes you wonder whether Apple cares about the MacBook Air, but nevertheless it‚Äôs a fine, long-lasting laptop for general use.The MacBook Air also has the advantage of legacy ports, which Apple has sadly discarded from its modern-day lineup. Whereas the 12-inch MacBook and MacBook Pro have gone all-in on USB Type-C and Thunderbolt 3, respectively, the MacBook Air retains the ‚Äòregular‚Äô USB 3.0 ports and SD card slots of the past.=====DESIGN=====By and large, the MacBook Air generally looks the same as it has since 2010, and there don‚Äôt appear to be any changes in tow, either. That‚Äôs a shame, particularly because we‚Äôre now seeing virtually bezel-less laptops with smaller footprints and high resolution screens that dismally put the MacBook Air in its place.Forget the Dell XPS 13's physics-defying InfinityEdge display, which is lightyears ahead ‚Äì even Apple's 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina, once seen as slightly tubby compared to the Air, has a smaller footprint and takes up slightly less space on your lap.Yet, the old ‚Äòif it ain't broke‚Äô mantra applies ‚Äì at least to a point. The MacBook Air's aluminum unibody design, which supports the main enclosure and the display, is as durable as ever. Its lid can be easily raised with a single hand and doesn't droop in any position, and you have to press really hard to detect flex on the machine's base or lid.It's also easy to clean with a damp cloth. If there's one drawback, it's that the aluminum body can scratch easily to leave permanent black marks, so you should consider buying a sleeve if you're going to sling it into a bag for transportation.The 13-inch MacBook Air is more interesting than the 11-inch model due to housing flash storage twice as fast as its predecessor ‚Äì or so Apple claims.=====SPEC SHEET=====CPU: 1.6GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 (Turbo Boost up to 2.7GHz) with 3MB shared L3 cacheGraphics: Intel HD Graphics 6000RAM: 8GB 1600MHz DDR3Screen: 13.3-inch, LED-backlit glossy widescreen display (1440 x 900)Storage: 256GB PCIe-based flash storage (configurable to 512GB flash storage)Optical Drive: Not includedPorts: Two USB 3.0 ports (up to 5Gbps); Thunderbolt 2 port (up to 20Gbps); MagSafe 2 power port; SDXC card slotConnectivity: 802.11ac Wi-Fi networking; IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n compatible; Bluetooth 4.0 wireless technologyCamera: 720p FaceTime HD cameraWeight: 1.35kgSize: 32.5 x 22.7 x 1.7 cm (W x D x H)One advantage of the MacBook Air versus the 12-inch MacBook is its wider selection of ports. On the left-hand side is a MagSafe 2 connector for power, one USB 3.0 port and a headphone jack. On the right is a Thunderbolt 2 port, another USB 3.0 port and a full-sized SDcard slot. The 13-inch Retina MacBook Pro doubles the number of Thunderbolt ports compared to the Air, and adds HDMI.macOS Sierra is the version currently shipping with Apple's 13-inch MacBook Air. It doesn‚Äôt divert too much from the visual style of its predecessor, OS X 10.11 El Capitan, but it does introduce a range of new features such as Siri, Continuity between your Mac and iOS devices and Apple Pay for expediting online purchases.Sierra has since been succeeded by macOS 10.13 High Sierra, though it doesn‚Äôt come with it out of the box ‚Äì you have to download and install it yourself, for free. There aren‚Äôt many significant improvements by way of macOS High Sierra, save for better security, VR support down the road and refinements to the Photos app.That said, given that you don‚Äôt have to pay for it, macOS High Sierra is probably worth the 4.8GB hit to your data cap for the also-new Apple File System (APFS) alone. The new 64-bit file system brings native encryption and faster metadata operations to the table, making the MacBook Air quicker to use as a result.=====BUNDLED SOFTWARE=====For now, macOS Sierra ships with Apple's own iWork and iLife apps, including a modernized look for Garageband.These include:-iMovie-Garageband-Pages-Numbers-Keynote-Safari-Mail-Messages-FaceTimeIn addition to:-Calendar-Contacts-Notes-App Store-iTunes-iBooks-Maps-Photo Booth-Time Machine-Spotlight=====PERFORMANCE=====Manufactured on the 14nm fabrication process, the 13-inch MacBook Air's Broadwell CPU is a die shrink of Intel's 22nm Haswell chip. It means better battery life versus last year's MacBook Air models, although the gains aren't on the same scale as the switch from Ivy Bridge to Haswell. Still, battery life was staggering, clocking up more than 13 hours when looping a 1080p video over Wi-Fi.=====BENCHMARKS=====-Cinebench R15 Single Core: 103cb cb; Multi Core: 255 cb-Cinebench R15 OpenGL: 24.91fps-Geek bench 3 Single Core: 2,873; Multi Core: 5,768-Xbench (CPU and disk): 469.55-NovaBench (Overall): 634; Graphics: 42-Unigine Heaven 4.0 (Medium); FPS: 14.4; Overall: 438-Blackmagic Disk Speed test: Write average: 612.4 Mbps; Read average: 1302.4 Mbps-Battery, streaming 1080p video via Wi-Fi: 13 hours and 24 minutesBroadwell brings performance gains too, even if they're nothing to shout about. The MacBook Air scored 5,768 on Geekbench 3's Multi Core CPU test, representing a 9% gain over the 13-inch Air from 2014. However, it proved 20% slower than the 2.7GHz Core i5 chip in the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina, which is to be expected considering that machine's faster clock speed.Apple's claim that the 2015 Air's storage is twice as fast as the 2014 version stands up. The MacBook averaged write speeds of 612.4 Mbps, and average read speeds of 1,243 Mbps, which gives the MacBook Air MacBook Pro-level storage speeds for the first time.The MacBook Pro with Retina's Iris Graphics 6100 proved 38% faster than the MacBook Air's HD Graphics 6000 in Unigine Heaven 4.0's benchmark. That said, Intel's decision to allocate die space to graphics on the CPU has been paying off for some time, and the MacBook Air is capable of playing a wide selection of games on low-medium settings with the resolution dialled down - especially when installed on a Windows partition using Boot Camp.The MacBook Air cranked out a smooth 60FPS played at 1440 x 900 with the graphics on medium, while Skyrim managed the high 50s played at the same res with the graphics on low. If your intention is to play games, you'll want to invest in a decent headset as the MacBook Air's speakers are tinny and unsatisfying. Apple managed to squeeze an impressive amount of low and mid-range tones into the 12-inch MacBook's speakers, but it's yet to use the same technology in the Air.If the MacBook Air's consistency of design can grow stale over time, this reviewer is happy for the keyboard to remain unchanged. Its slightly convex keys are the best I've used yet on a computer, and that includes the new MacBook, Lenovo's ThinkPad notebooks and Logitech's well-regarded Mac keyboards. Even the MacBook Pro with Retina's keys, which are hardly uncomfortable, feel stiff in comparison. The keyboard is also backlit and easy to clean.The MacBook Air's trackpad is just as impressive, providing a smooth gliding action that makes executing OS X's trackpad commands a breeze. It's just a shame that Apple didn't carry over the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina's Force Touch Trackpad ‚Äì it's once again regular two-button clicking action for owners of Apple's slimmer machine.Apple's decision to put a 480p camera in the 12-inch MacBook was a poor one, and thankfully it hasn't followed suited with the MacBook Air. At 720p it's up to the task of Skype and Google Hangout sessions, producing sufficiently clear and defined images.=====VERDICT=====Like a pair of old trainers, Apple's 2015 MacBook Air is boring, familiar, reliable and more than up to the task. If you don't need tons of screen real-estate (or a half-decent screen for that matter), or prefer to hook your laptop up to an external monitor, it remains the most solid all-rounder out there today, whether you're desk-bound or frequently travelling.The MacBook Air's stellar battery life remains best-in-class for a 13-inch laptop, and its keyboard is the best in the business. The addition of Thunderbolt 2 will go a long way if you own compatible peripherals. Its storage speeds hold up to Apple's ""twice as fast"" claims and will prove a boon for those who regularly copy information to their Mac's storage drive.New machine, same chassis. Apple's reluctance to give the MacBook Air a Retina display is wearing thin, and it's causing buyers to look at alternatives ‚Äì even defecting to Windows in some cases. Its lack of personality is compounded by poor speakers, an unsightly bezel and large footprint. Simply put, the MacBook Air just isn't that cool anymore.Much faster storage and a better performing processor/graphics combo make this year's 13-inch MacBook Air a technically better machine than its predecessor, but unless you really need those gains it's not worth the upgrade. That's particularly so in the absence of any new features ‚Äì such as the Retina MacBook Pro's Force Touch Trackpad.Elsewhere, it's business as usual: while the MacBook Pro with Retina is a faster than the Air and packs more features, Apple's lighter machine is no slouch. And while the Retina model is chunkier than the Air, it's not a great deal heavier and has a smaller footprint. With both machines residing in the same price bracket, the deciding factor is more likely to be how prepared you are to put up with the MacBook Air's outdated display.If this review was helpful, please consider clicking on the helpful tab.

1917,5.0 stars,"  Writing this review after using it for more than a year. First thing first, I was lucky to find this product on the first day of 2017 Big billion day sale on the offer prize of 4_,000 + cashback (Will reveal the price in the end). Moving on, my previous laptop was a HP (Compaq), so undoubtedly this was a huge upgradation for me. However, i have used a lot of other laptops too. But within a single week of using Macbook, I realized what the hype was all about. Every tiny and simple thing matters a lot.1. Battery ""ROCKS"" - matters when you spend around the entire day, studying, browsing and working on it.2. Magsafe charger - is fun and highly compact and light comparatively to all other chargers3. Light weight - matters when u travel to work/school everyday with it in your backpack4. MacOS - a completely different experience (However, there are some cons to it, will mention below.)5. Multi-gesture trackpad - I have used other multigesture trackpads in other laptops. No one even comes close. This one is smooth as butter.6. Close the lid, put it in bag -> and then take it out and open the lid - Thats it! Life is so easy...However, a few points of concern especially in India.1. It is no more that affordable.2. Since MacOs is not at all common across India, so one constantly be conscious to convert the file types (MS word, Powerpoint, Ecxel etc.) before forwarding them.3. Softwares and Apps - no more best of the stuffs for free.4. Games - I guess everyone knows about this offcourse :(Overall, I hope I am never forced to go back to those fat, heavy and unconvincing laptops again. Life is easier this way.Oh Yeah! It was 43,500/-"

I hadn't even thought about buying it online but it hit me one day to look on Amazon and I am SO glad that I did. The pricing for the exact same product here in store (and without tax!) is CHEAPER. I saved SO much money buying this Macbook here on Amazon and I do NOT regret this purchase one bit! I DID think about it a lot and read every last review and looked at all the product pictures (which were all good) and I'm glad to say that I also got a BRAND NEW PACKAGED BY APPLE MACBOOK AIR 13.3 INCH LAPTOP! It was sealed shut in the original Apple packaging brand new! Everything is running smoothly, no problems whatsoever (though I am VERY nervous of leaving a scratch or something on it so I bought a rubberized case & carrying case to keep it safe & looking new!)NOW, though the product title DOES say that it comes preinstalled with the SIERRA update. It had Sierra Version 10.12.3 and in the app store, you can update it (FOR FREE) with the May 2017 recent Sierra 10.12.5 update! IF yours comes in with EL CAPTAIN, you can update it FOR FREE to the 2017 Sierra update - do not worry! Lol.Now I don't see any big CONS to this laptop (for ME anyway) but here are my PROS:- Editing is smooth-Battery life is AMAZING. It also charges fast!- Love the simplicity off this laptop!-Everything runs smooth and is simple to access (unless you're coming from windows,etc)- The design- The back light on the keyboard & apple on back- The screen (which a lot of people complain about but there's nothing wrong with it? Pst picky people!)- Loading screens are quick- Love how it connects to my phone and i can facetime and imessage- Size is perfect- Love how slim and thin it is though I'm sometimes afraid I might drop it lol- Usb ports/sd card slot (This laptop will forever be Apples BEST laptop. Why did they take basically ALL of the ports off of the Pro's?)- Light gaming runs VERY well (for hours) with no problems or restarting & resolution is perfect (I play Sims 4)- There's enough space- Continues to get the latest updates- Magnetic charger (also love how the charger light indicates if it's charged or not)ConsI will say it can be a bit cumbersome to use the pad. I like a traditional mouse better, but this is easily resolved by attaching a wireless mouse (which I have for this computer - thank you USB port!)It doesn't have a CD drive (bummer for watching dvds/playing cds)Anyways, there's A LOT that I love about this laptop. I recommend this laptop to anyone who is looking for one! Thanks Apple!"

1932,5.0 stars,  This is one of the best laptops for the price. I've been using this laptop for the past  2 year and it still works like a charm. I use the 4 gb variant which is still far better than any 4gb variant of windows laptops in this price bracket.

1938,3.0 stars,"  Good product. Sweet and simple looks, performance as expected. No issues with the product.Disappointed to see the price has been slashed down from ‚Çπ55,400/- to ‚Çπ44,990/- within few days and loyal customers don't get any sort of protection for these drastic changes!"

1942,5.0 stars,"  I buy this one on this Diwali at a discount price of 50k. The RetailNet was the seller and their packaging and delivery were good. After using this one for almost one month I decided to write a Review of this product.Lets Talk about its Pros & Cons:Pros:1) The best battery life I ever saw on a laptop. I am a software developer and this laptop clearly gives me 8-9 hours of battery life on continuous web surfing in chrome and programming. Really impressed and I only need to charge it at morning and it last all day. The charging time was also good 1.5 hours from 20-100%.2) The beautiful Smooth Aluminum premium built quality. The laptop is very thin and lightweight. No Heating at all.3) The best track pad and gestures. The 3 finger to drag and drop was a hidden feature but it is definitely recommended to turn on. The Keyboard was also good.4) Very fast booting ie 10 seconds. The application opening time was also fast for example after boot when I click chrome it open in split seconds. Previously when I am using windows laptop with SSHD it takes at least 5 seconds to open the applications after boot. I am impressed with the performance of SSD.5) The front Camera quality is really good for video calling.Cons:1) No direct support for NTFS formatted external hard disk. The free solution is Mounty.2) The os is not as user-friendly as windows. Please note that it is my personal opinion. In Windows, we can minimize and maximize application by clicking on icons in Taskbar. The file manager is also more user-friendly in windows ie enter to open files and back key to move back etc. The cut copy and paste shortcuts also different. Remember these are not big deals and you will get used to it in a week.Final VerdictAnyway, in my opinion, it is the best laptop you can buy for this price range. The performance and battery life were awesome and the display was not bad as others say. The display was good and bright and colour production is also good but it's clarity loss on side angles. This product is shipped with Mac Os Sierra and you can easily upgrade to High Sierra. It is a 6 gb download and will take 1 hour to install. But there will not be any crashing or problems during installation."
1943,5.0 stars,"  GREAT LAPTOP!!!In this price range the best you can buy, if you dont play games.It is the best choice for students , i am also a student.Using it from last year .no complains at all"
1944,4.0 stars,"  Not exactly the best features within this price range and not the best display in today's generation of FHD. But still believe it's worth it when it comes to quality, build and responsiveness. And not to forget Apple products last very long and remain new even after years of use. Battery actually lasts about 9 hours with video streaming, screen brightness is great and keyboard is well lit with automatic sensors. Keys are sturdy and the touch pad is as smooth as 16 year old whiskey. Definitely a good choice for the apple experience at a power budget."

1955,1.0 stars,"  Please be cautious, the SSD in the machines in India are giving up too early. Mine got spoiled in 18 months usage. Replace for new SSD cost is around 45000/- in Indian service centres. Used SSDs are available for 20k.  My colleague's machine lasted for 20 moths. Decide for yourself.Curse me if I discouraged you. Bless me if it serves as wisdom. You may be lucky."
1956,5.0 stars,"  I was also in the same catagory who thinks Apple products are costly and people buy for the brand name, trust me my perceptions changed after using this ""solid weapon"", after a long wait and many research I bought this laptop.you get most slim and stylish laptop in just 50k, MAC OS is just awesome, nothing can beat this, performance and style is unmatchable with any other laptop in this price range, most light weight and fastest processor ever I used.-If we talk about RAM 4GB is pretty enough for normal official use if you aren't looking for kids job of gaming and all.-Apple i5 processors are even better than being used in any other brands like DELL, HP, LENOVO and others.-Privacy protection makes Apple as one sided winner in this race.-128GB is sufficient if you are looking for professional work or personal use(keep storing movies aside), can easily get 1TB hard disk in just 1-3k for t  that there is no sense to buy 256GB version or above-It looks much better than other apple laptops-web camera is better than apple's Retina display variant-2017 model is much improved and advanced-9 hours battery back up that is unbelievable for its competitors, no doubt why apple is the biggest brand and king of this industry-Finally a person who is looking to get a laptop within 60k, undoubtedly go for it if your purpose is browsing and other basic official stuffs"

1958,5.0 stars,  Very lightweight Macbook Air  ..1.35 kg weight...battery also good..air is dispaly not a retina display ..camera also good .....nice protoct
1959,5.0 stars,  My best online purchase till date. I wonder why I even used windows computers over all those years. I am sure about one thing that I am not going to use any other computer other than mac in my life.You might want to consider buying a keyboard skin cover though.
1960,1.0 stars,  Within 1.5 years twice motherboard changed.Fortunately 1st time it was under warranty or else would have costed me 45k . No trust on Apple now. Had been a loyal customer for long.

1964,4.0 stars,"  This is an honest unbiased review from someone who bought a Mac (and always was satisfied with Windows) for the first time.Pros:Literally everything, except the cons.Cons:Display is basic. Colors lack vividness and it isn't Full HD. Professional Photo editing is impossible.Apple technical support is pathetic. My Mac tried to update automatically to high sierra and failed because of new file system. Now here's the catch. If the telephone execs can't help you out, you'll have to go to a service centre and pay a fortune for no mistake of yours. Glad that didn't happen because of a techie friend of mine.Apple servers are super slow. (At least in India)Mac vs windows :  after using this for a year, I'm of the opinion that  windows OS is way more flexible and more user friendly than  ios. The only reason I m sticking to this is cuz of the build quality and sturdiness .Verdict: if you can get this  for > Rs. 55000 ,aren't into photo editing and battery backup and weight are your top priorities, no windows laptop out there can beat this."
1965,1.0 stars,  Which is the best laptop for software  coding under 50000 ?Mac book is good for coding ?Any other brand with 1tb hard drive n 8 gb ram

1968,1.0 stars,"  Totally nuisance to purchase a laptop from amazon. I have purchased the MacBook Air in September 2017 & I hardly used it about 10 hours till date. Now yesterday when I start this laptop it suddenly goes off and after that when I start it again, no response from the laptop. On the other hand when I call the amazon customer care no body is listening."
1969,3.0 stars,  Outdated for 2018 better spend 10k ro 15k more for a much better mac book
1970,1.0 stars,  Too much lag. I hate this
1971,1.0 stars,"  So far there has been couple of issues with the hardware:1. There is continuous beeping sound from the Mac, online support forums indicates it to be RAM issue.. No luck with Apple support yet.2. One of the USB port doesnt seem to work.I would recommend users to rather go for a model thats been around for some time."
1972,5.0 stars,"  Click helpful, if u want price drop again to 44k. More hits will make it to appear at top and more chances to be seen by buisness amazon analysts. Support by pressing helpful."
1973,5.0 stars,  Eagerly waiting for the prices to drop back to ~‚Çπ45000
1974,3.0 stars,  I give 3 stars for being a apple product and cut 2 stars because it is 2018 and it still using fifth gen processor which cant stay longer after 2020 and your money will waste.
1975,5.0 stars,  Personally recommend to all Dogital Marketing Specialist and Managers.A perfect device to manage all your clients in one go.
1976,4.0 stars,  Apple MacBook Air has one disadvantage. its body has cooled in the winter season. you have thought much time to touch air body
1977,5.0 stars,  Proud owner since 2015. Terrific performance and no issues so far. Battery still lasts 9-10hrs.
1978,5.0 stars,  i bought it for my dad on his birthday. he absolutely loved it.according to him this is so far his best experience with a laptop.thank you amazon.
1979,5.0 stars,  The best for people who want basic computing power and extended battery life. I installed Windows 10 and MS office with boot camp and works perfectly. Now I have both Mac and Win 10 on a 1.3 kg.laptop having 14 hours battery. Buy a 3TB external HDD also. The perfect combo for computing on the move. The design just keeps turning eye balls everywhere. It is my work machine. I have another gaming laptop as workstation but this is my best companion. Power of Mac and Win in a pint sized machine. A miracle of modern science.
1980,5.0 stars,  I am not happy with the packaging of product.
1981,5.0 stars,  Super
1982,5.0 stars,"  NOTE: If the full review is not visible, then click on the review title to open the full review in a new tab.This is to address all the doubts and misconceptions amongst the windows ‚ÄòPOWER USERS‚Äô who are skeptical about shifting to mac. Read this review once and I bet you would end up with a deep urge to own this beast.for the note - I am a computer science engineering student, making visual effects and graphic designs is my hobby and I may have used almost any power/resource hogging application you can ever think of.NOW TO THE POINT-MISCONCEPTIONS -1. Macs are overpriced.WRONG.Macs are not overpriced. You get what you pay for(bear with the uncalled analogy here) if you go and buy a Ferrari, then you pay the hefty amount for the cost of expensive parts that make up the car, and a bit for brand name. MACS ARE THE FERRARIS OF THE LAPTOP WORLD.Just pick one up in any apple store and you will agree to agree.It is not difficult to say that no company today is able to produce what apple does. They just follow up.2. Macs and windows are different/ you cannot use macs if your company uses windows.WRONG.There are softwares like crossover which run most of the famous windows software in Macs without the need to install windows separately.For those who want to install windows separately, there is a pre installed application called bootcamp, which helps you dual boot the laptop with windows and mac. So you can run both mac and windows(one at a time) and the computer will be able to utilise all the resources in running the OS used at that time. Virtual machines are also an option but they do not use full resources of the laptop.Apple is a hardware AND software company. And just the hardware is enough to mesmerise you.and here hardware refers to the RETINA screen, slim and super sturdy build, best battery life and an out of the world trackpad, whose gestures can be controlled in any way you want using a software called better touch tool. So much possibilities, sky is the limit. And trust me, unless absolutely necessary, you yourself will not want to go back to windows after using OS X.3. Macs cannot run games.First of all, you never buy a mac to play games. But if you play occasionally, then it is possible.Inbuilt iris graphics(1.5gb) are enough to play any games a casual gamer can think of(that does not mean that you can crank watchdogs at ultra), here casual means casual. Say all ps2 games. I'm rocking Tekken 5 through PCSX2 at 60 fps.4. Macs have wifi problemsWRONG.I have only experienced connection drops when my router was bad, and it was experienced in all devices I own, nothing special about macs. And there is nothing as WIFI COMPATIBILITY. wifi is wifi. any devices which can catch wifi signals can use wifi as efficiently as others. Also, it catches signals from routers far off from my house, which my nexus 7 can‚Äôt catch. So another thumbs up.5. OS X user interface stuttersWRONG.Yosemite(which comes pre installed into these devices now) is still in early stages of development and Apple rolls out new updates to fix any bugs that may come in the way of the users after installing new os. Just keep your os updated and it will run silky smooth. So any stutter/lag/anomaly you may experience will be due to software which is constantly evolving, there is no hardware problem or impotent CPU. Also, if you notice lag only on some specific(and less famous) websites this is because they are not(yet) optimised for retina display and this will only get better in future as apple is shifting all of it's devices to retina display.6. Macs are less powerful for what they costWRONG.You want an example of power? My current cpu usage is 8% and 92% of it is sitting idle while I am writing this review in pages(an application like MS word for OS X, and it is pre installed, and it is better than word, and it is free) with 3 tabs open in safari and two background applications running(f.lux and better touch tool). Windows, beat that!!enough of misconceptions, now some DOUBT CLEARING FOR WINDOWS POWER USERS.DOUBTS -1. Are macs good for programming?ans- They are the best. Because mac os is based on unix, programming in them is just like/even better than programming on a linux machine. Linux is also unix based. You can write applications for OS X, IOS, Windows and android in a mac, but only for the latter two in windows.2. Are macs good for education?ans- They are the best. Because there are pre installed applications for almost all the utilities a student would need. The ones I love are ibooks,itunes U(where you can join courses, specifically for undergraduates), ilife suite, ability to use 16 different desktops at a time and sliding through them like a breeze. There is an inbuilt dictionary, when you want to look for the meaning of any word anywhere, just do a three finger tap on the word and the meaning in dictionary, in thesaurus, in wikipedia pop up in a box. There is also an application called grapher, which plots 2D and/or 3D graphs of any equation you type in the box provided. There is Magsafe 2 port which detaches itself from the laptop if a sudden force is applied on the wire, but strongly sticks there if you try to pull gently. And trust me on this, you will step on your charging wire. Magsafe comes in handy for that.3. Do macs last long?ans- If the one you received did not show any signs of manufacturing defect initially, then rest assured that they are going to last as long as the hardware becomes obsolete in the long run, only unless you are an unlucky chap with a bad logic board. Treat them well and they will serve you a very very long time. Just buy apple care in the first year and that makes the warranty from one year to three years(it does not cover battery though)TIPS TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR MAC -1. Do not cover the ports and spaces made for fans and keyboard too(if possible). These are the places from where heat is dissipated and/or fresh air is drawn for cooling. And any hardware which overheats does not last long. That does not mean you cannot cover it, just do not cover the places stated above, that is, do not cover any hole you see.2. Clean the dust off the keyboard and ports of fans frequently. That does not mean after every five minutes, but at least thrice a week. It does not take long, but assures longer life for your device.(I do it everyday before going to bed LOL)3. Use a screen protector!! I know retina screens are gorgeous but they are ultimately going to get scratched(accidentally). Any and every screen protector WILL degrade the screen quality a bit. But it‚Äôs something I can live with, decide for yourself.If screen protector is not your thing, then do not touch or let anybody touch or press the screen and clean it regularly.4. Silicon keyboard covers while using are a big no no. Apple exec told me this.5. Charge the laptop for short durations. Do not drain the battery all the way down to 0 from 100. This is bad for your battery. Even though Apple execs do not agree with this, but this is a general rule of thumb for Lithium Ion batteries. Batteries have to die ultimately, but you can slow down the process by treating them right.Charge in small splurges and try to keep it above 50% when possible. Do not think that using the laptop while running on ac supply with full battery will reduce your charge cycles and postpone the battery death. You are preponing it by doing so. Just like exercise is important for humans, it is for your battery too.6. Do not use google chrome, it consumes more battery(see in activity monitor)Use safari instead, it runs better.And after spending more than an hour writing this review and recollecting everything I think is helpful for new comers to the Apple family, I just want to say that take my word for it, YOU CANNOT GO WRONG WITH A MAC. And this price is too tempting. Just pick one up and if you do not like it you can return it before 10 days of delivery are up. As they say - ‚Ä®ONCE YOU GO MAC, YOU NEVER GO BACKUPDATE 14/03/15About the screen protector - After using screen protector for a month, I decided to remove it because it added extra glare to the screen which significantly decreased the screen quality. First it felt like a trade off between safety and clarity, but then it didn't take long to realize that with a screen protector you are not enjoying what you paid big bucks for. So rather than protecting it, enjoy it to the fullest.Also, initially, the retina display appeared to be straining my eyes a bit, but after a few weeks, the eyes adjusted to it and now it feels like reading on paper, without any strain.UPDATE 02/11/17It has been almost 2.5 years and I am very happy with my purchase. Also, all the points listed above still hold true today. Hope this helped you guys!"

1984,5.0 stars,  awsm product üòçüòç
1985,4.0 stars,  Good product
1986,5.0 stars,  Great just go for it now!
1987,4.0 stars,  Amazing product by Apple. No complaints so far. Much better than windows laptop which do not last long. Happy with the purchase
1988,5.0 stars,"  I bought this laptop after wondering if it's justified enough for me to purchase a MacBook Pro 13"" in India which costed nearly 122k with just 8 GB RAM and 256 GB SSD, now having purchased a base config MacBook Air, I am very happy, mainly because I was able to buy it for under 45k by exchanging my older Lenovo laptop which was giving me a severe headache.I'm a software engineer and I have a company issued MacBook Pro 15"" late 2016, I wanted a MacBook which I could use for my personal tasks so I began looking for one, after looking at various models at different Apple stores I came to a conclusion that it's not worth buying a 2017 MacBook Pro as theres no significant advantages or reasons to buy one over lets say a 2015 MacBook Pro, the differences are very minor and unnoticeable in your day to day tasks. Even the screens are not revolutionary, they are not 4K yet and they do not fully support 4K and 5K video playback, my iPhone 7 and iPad Pro 10.5"" are way faster when compared to these newer Macs if you look at just the benchmarking scores, I hope this explains why I think that they are not worth their money.Now let's talk about MacBook Air, I don't understand why it gets so much bad rap,I get that the screen is not very good, but it's still very good, it's better than any other Windows laptop you could buy at this price.Configuration:It has 8 GB RAM and 128 GB SSD and has a i5 5350U processor which is an excellent configuration.Storage:Out of the box I got about 102 GB to work with, after the software update and installing Java, Android Studio, XCode, IntelliJ and some apps from Mac Store, I was left with about 90 GB, this is very very good.Performance:The performance is a breeze, I had about 20 tabs open in Chrome and Safari and still had over 5 GB RAM to work with, Android Studio and X Code run like a breeze, startup time is excellent and I was able to launch simulators on both editors in an instant and due to abundant RAM using both code editors at the same time is possible. Geekbench 4 score was about 3500 for single core and 6800 for multi core.Battery Life:Battery Life is phenomenal, I am able to consistently pull off 13-14 hours every day, I am very happy with this.Keyboard and Trackpad:Keyboard and Trackpad are in the league of their own, they are springy and very very responsive, Mac OS has these track pad shortcuts that work very well and save you time if you know where to use them.Ports:2 USB 3.0 ports, 1 Thunderbolt Display port, a headphone jack and a Mag safe charger port so yeah you won't have to carry those adapters around.Build:Very lightweight, durable and portableScreen:Not the best in the world but its very much manageable, it's noticeable if you use a retina MacBook Pro like me at office, but for me this is a non issue since I hook it up to an external monitor.Verdict:This is the best bang for buck laptop you can buy, Mac OS is the best OS out there, the hardware is the best you can buy and performance is very very good, it's not at all as bad as the reviewers write, it has an i5 processor for gods sake. In short if you want a laptop that can last for half a decade or more buy this, you won't regret."
1989,5.0 stars,"  So, I bought MacBook Air 2017 finally, like after 6 to 7 months of introspection. September, 21 2017 2:00 AM I placed the order, the Great Indian E-comm competition benefited me immensely. Flipkart and Amazon contested aggressively during the wee ours of 21 September. Price of MacBook Air dropped from 57K to 50.. then 47 ‚Ä¶ 45..44. After observing this price war for 30 to 40 mins. I made sure to order it when the price hit the lower circuit. Like people traded on Stock Exchange right after the opening bell, I was waiting for the price to drop and hit that order button. Around 2 AM I was sure 42 was the best price I could get it for. Though it could drop further, I didn‚Äôt want to let go this opportunity, and finally did the transaction.Coming to the user experience, believe me this is one of the best you can get at this price. Every penny is worth. Build quality, touch pad, OS, shortcuts, brink of an eye boot up and the forever battery will mesmerise you.This machine captivates you at every instance you use it, they have put so much in designing the OS and its feature.Also, the size of the machine is a wonder in itself."
1990,5.0 stars,  totally worth the price! gives a feel of quality ! and machine always keeps up with users pace !As far as specs are concerned it outperforms a Windows laptop with 8th gen i5 as well!

1995,5.0 stars,"  The only thing I don't like is the pages app (the native doc file opener) as the text in the doc file from MS Word seems totally misaligned when opened in pages app.....For those who have a doubt regarding the Display of MacBook after reading a lot of comments, Display on MacBook Air is Beautiful if you previously owned a budget windows laptop with 1336x768 display. Ofcourse if you had a Full HD High Quality (not the cheap lenovo /acer panels found in low or mid segment laptop) panel found in laptops of range 60-120k laptops then you will have a problem, otherwise just go for it."

2000,5.0 stars,"  Bought this product from Paytm mall and got a cashback of Rs.7000. Effectively I got this for Rs.51,000. I'm a software developer and nothing makes life easy than this macbook air. Build quality of product is very good.Edit September 2019:The system is still going great but there's the storage problem. It's a 128gb ssd and it runs out of space very soon. The hardware is not upgradable. Youbcan buy new ssd for this from transcend but it costs another 30k. So buy a MacBook only if you plan on building iPhone apps. Otherwise go for an upgradable computer!"

2004,4.0 stars,"  Apple has merely tweaked the processor speed with its 2017 update to its MacBook Air, but it remains an affordable, lightweight, compact cracker of a laptop.In June 2017 Apple updated the processor on its 13in MacBook Air from 1.6GHz to 1.8GHz - not a massive improvement as the processor is the same generation as the MacBook Air used when it was last significantly updated in 2015 - but the MacBook Air remains a great choice for an entry-level Mac laptop.The MacBook Air is the laptop you see in coffee shops, libraries, offices, and student digs all over the world. Apple might have forgotten it in favour of the sharper-screened 13in and 15in MacBook Pro and dinkier 12in MacBook, but the masses still love the lightweight, entry-level Air.Apple isn‚Äôt calling its most recent MacBook Air update a ‚Äúnew‚Äù model, but to distinguish it from its otherwise very similar Early-2015 MacBook Air we‚Äôll call it the Mid-2017 MacBook Air."

2009,5.0 stars,"  Its an amazing machine. Although after researching a lot on different sites I purchased from paytm in diwali sale. Earlier I was worried that should I trust paytm for this costly product  but after enquiringwith friends and some research in google I  took this bold step. U won't believe I got an amazing deal, Original price was 58000 there and 14000 was cash back so it cost me around 44000 only on top of that I got 1500 cash back of icici bank so the total purchase price was 42500 only.I searched the ""brand trusted vendor"" in paytm and ordered from there. Got delivery in 5 days. It was very well packed and I made a video while unpacking it. I am happy it's as genuine as we purchase from store.Checked guarantee online by putting order no on apple site  it was all good , one year from purchase date.so all genuine at very reasonble price.Working on Mac air is different experience it's very slim and very fast for any task. Speakers are amazing.Go for itüëçSorry for the long postüòä"

2026,5.0 stars,"  It has been almost a year since I purchased it in 2016 . Some of the great features that make this Macbook Air the most unique laptop in the world.Pros.1. Lightweight. well I guess when this Macbook Air was in circulation in 2015 , there was not a single one as light as this one. Light weight makes it so easy to carry even between rooms.2. Battery backup . Could easily go for 12 hours if used like a office user ( Document processing , we browsing and minimal multimedia usage .Charging takes not more than 1 hour.3. Backlit Keyboard , Decent audio on speakers for a laptop of this size and weight , excellent audio on headphone.4.Great Trackpad ( One of the most comfortable trackpads normally found in Macbooks but not even in expensive Windows laptops )5. Boot Time - 5 to 6 secs , Same for Windows installed in Bootcamp partition.Cons.1. I would say expensive especially when it was first released it was about Rs 80000/- . I bought it for 60000/- . Now available for 45000/-.2. Screen not very good . This is more of a problem of Mac OS compatability with a non Retina Screen. I actually has installed Windows 10 with Bootcamp and Windows looked great .3. Minimal Ports . Although this is like a personal browsing machine a little more sophisticated gadget than a Ipad .That being said . I think this is a great machine for busy executives  who wants machine to be active for 14- 15 hours , Wake up time from sleep not more than 1 sec , Boot time not more than 5 secs and very easy and light weight to carry .But this is not a powerhouse not by 2017 standards. Now we have much better alternatives Like Dell XPS 13 , Asus Zenbook3 , Hp Xpectre 360  and even the 2017 models of Macbook pro - all with i7 processors , 16 GB ram , maybe sporting a separate graphics card , All the required ports , Touch screen etc.But if you already have , this is a great digital companion to have."

2029,4.0 stars,  If you are buying it for around 55k(by using discount s) then go for it otherwise I will not worth the money.
2030,5.0 stars,"  I purchased MacBook Air for Rs 44400/- (got 12100+1500 cash back paytm and icici at amount of 58000rs) from Paytm. Placed order on 5th of oct 2017 got in three 3 days. Brand new with one year warranty. If you really want to buy apple, this is a good choice at just 44k.Short Story:-  Like most user if you want to have a machine for student life or office work( documentation, spreadsheets etc), or for surfing net ( fb, Instagram, wikipedia, youtube, blogs etc) or watching videos etc or coding Xcode , android thing, js crap, python, than this machine is really powerful to handle all these stuff. Plus point - if you are a traveller or don‚Äôt spent most of time at one place than you have to carry only this machine, no other adapter or any other usb hub. It has great build, truly great battery life and all the essential ports (not even 2lac MacBook has this level of battery life and it entangles you in the web of adapters and adapters and adapters & hubs too)Long story:-About Myself: I am 28 years old at the time of writing. I am a windows user (and some time linux user) for the past 18 years. It was a really long time with Mr Microsoft. I am a developer (java, android, c++ and other rubbish stuff) as well as a pc gamer (Battlefield series, NFS series, GTA series, Crysis series and other great stuff).What I own right now : I have a really good win lappy. Its from Hp. 15inch, 4 core i5 processor, 8gb ram, 2gb GDDR5 nvidia card 512gb ssd, decent battery life on moderate use(around 3-4 hours as of now) cost me some 80-90k INR. It is somewhat 3 years old machine and I really love it. I am a proud owner of it. I use it for coding, net surfing, gaming , watching movies, checking emails etc. And I believe it will continue to be my partner for another 3-4 years.Why I want to buy apple :  The time has come when I want to expand my horizon in the world of coding and if I want to develop some thing for apple than the tool(laptop, desktop etc) has to be, has to be apple.Why MacBook Air 2017 model : 3 major reasons behind this:- 1. I want to have a lappy for coding Xcode etc and surfing net (mostly reading articles, youtube, fb) 2.  I want to flaunt (people really get impressed if you own an apple thing). 3. The lappy must have a glowing apple logo.(ohh That light of perfection !) 4. It has to cheap (I don‚Äôt earn lots and lots of money).MacBook is a really great laptop. Read all other review to know about its greatness, solid build quality, very thin, very light, truly great battery life. The only 2017 laptop which still has a glowing apple logo( I am kind of obsessed about it).Some people complain about its display, but I didn‚Äôt felt it bad. It is not fantastic but it is still good. Some made noise regarding 128gb ssd but it is still enough to keep all your personal and important things. For movies or songs collection you can but external storage device.Remember : This is not a gaming machine or for video editing and other similar works."

2042,1.0 stars,"  If you‚Äôre okay with spending so much money and then see your laptop just randomly dead just around over a year then i will recommend you this laptop. A perfectly working well maintained and kept device just stops working for no reason after 1 month expired warrenty. This is not just my experience but of 3/10 apple laptop users. Replacement of motherboard costs around 40,000 bucks, might as well buy a new laptop instead. Even if anyone is deciding to buy this laptop i will not recommend to buy it with a qualiy trust in the brand but your luck."
2043,5.0 stars,"  No words to say. MacBook is everything you need from coding , surfing web , watching movies ,doing stuffs like ppt , excel to high end tasks like video editing and that too at a price of ‚Çπ43500 . Apple deserves all praise and special thanks to amazon for getting me avail such a portable and high performance at such a reasonable price"
2044,5.0 stars,"  Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  ¬†I am always a Windows guy since 2002. Playing games, doing programming, watching movies, downloading stuff, etc. etc... all was done in Windows. Since 2014, when I moved from business to programming skill I decided to go with the Apple Laptop, but I always stand by because of the high Apple prices.My friend has MacBook pro because he used to do editing stuff, but my purpose of buying MacBook Air is for programming only.My HP Laptop which I had bought in the year 2010 now finally sold in OLX in right price and at that amount I have purchased MacBook Air 2018 Edition üíª in OCT 2017, my Diwali presents üôÇ at a huge discounted price.To be honest, I moved from Hackintosh To Macintosh üòÅ . I have written some PRO TIPS.========================‚ù§Ô∏è Description: ‚ù§Ô∏èApple switched the 1.6GHz in 2017 model to 1.8GHz in 2018 model is the Broadwell processor from 2014-2015. Apple also updated the RAM from 4GB to 8GB as standard, and this is what Apple has updated on 2018 model. I got the laptop on Brand new sealed packaged by Apple MacBook Air 13.3"" with the lovely box inside which contains laptop along with power adapter, Apple stickers, and manual guides.Apple preinstalled the Sierra OS after then you should update to the latest version from the app store for free.========================üíéüíéüíé  PRO TIPS: üíéüíéüíéüí° BATTERYüí° - PLEASE PAY ATTENTION HERE ‚Äì This is one of the best technology I found Lithium battery. Likewise, in Windows Laptop, we required unplugging the power immediately when it reached to 100% due to overcharged it started to reduce your battery life, BUT in MacBook, due to Lithium polymer batteries, there is no need to calibrate your MacBook battery providing it is post-2009 as they come pre-calibrated. This means you do not need to drain your battery and charge it back up again. In fact, it will hurt your battery more.Second of all, plug your MacBook whenever possible. The lower the battery cycles ‚Äì the better. Try not to let your battery % down to below 30%.it will do more harm than good‚Ä¶ Long story short, just plug it in whenever you can! There is the lots of debate regarding this, but you can search more on Google.üí° SCROLLING SPEEDüí° - Sierra does not have a smooth scrolling like in Yosemite, this is one disappointed point, to get smooth scrolling you can download the app ""Smooze Mac,"" price is also very low at Rs324 only.üí° HIGH SIERRAüí° - Please don't update your OS to high sierra, it is not yet stable and having some issues. Better to stay on default OS ""Sierra.""========================üéâüéâüéâ  Pros: üéâüéâüéâüëç  KEYBOARD - Smooth chiclet keys with Backlit. Backlit can be control through function keys and our lovely bright Apple logo on the backside of the screen.üëç  TRACKPAD - Awesome trackpad with multi-touch gestures, entirely different style than Windows laptop.üëç  KEYS => Total 12 function keys including Brightness, backlit, multimedia.üëç  BATTERY => Everyone saying battery life is 12 hours but only when you leave the laptop in idle mode or writing documents in the word which doesn't consume memory, I worked with 3-4 chrome tabs, programming apps which consume memory and then complete battery backup I got is 7-8 hours only. It takes just 45-60 min for fully charged.üëç  SSD => The name itself said it all. I came from Windows laptop which had a normal HDD to SSD Apple laptop, and the speed is awesome, Boot takes only 5-10 seconds, unbelievable. Only 128GB data but you get 98GB because the rest of the OS and other preinstalled apps installed.üëç  SCREEN - I have seen lots of HIGH TECH people complain about screen quality and pixels issue, but I haven't seen anything so far, however, if they are comparing to retina display with this one then I can't say anything more.üëç  PROTECTION - It doesn't get hot or overheat, you can keep it without required cooling stand, this is what I want. Fan is entirely silent, and you can't even think this laptop has any fan inside :Düëç  ADAPTER - It has a MagSafe magnetic power connector, I like the sound ""tuck"" when I connect to the laptop. The most advantage I found on this if you accidentally pull out the wire forcefully the adapter smoothly removed it from the laptop without dropping the laptop like in Windows laptop. It also comes with both 2 and 3 pin power plug, good for traveling.üëç  COMPONENTS - It has two USB 3.0 ports, Thunderbolt 2, Headphone, SD card slot and dual mics support.üëç  WEIGHT - It is so lightweight, and only 2kg compare to my previous 5.5kg laptop. It is so slim. I am always scared of dropping it lol...üëç  ANTIVIRUS - Mac is a Unix based OS, as a UNIX-based OS macOS is sandboxed, it doesn't really get viruses, it is robust way to find the entrance of the virus until you do something very suspicious,so no expenses on Antivirus but if you are still worried you can go for free antiviruses like Avast, Malwarebytes, ClaimXav, and Sophos.üëç  EDITING - I tried Photoshop and Lightroom for editing and it goes very smooth, so it will also work on After Effects and FCP.üëç  PROGRAMMING - My background is computer science, so I bought this laptop for programming. I am using Android Studio, Xcode, Visual Studio, it is still a fast especially Android studio, unbelievable output, I always give A+ for editing and programming.üëç  SPEAKERS ‚Äì It is crispy, clear and loud.üëç  CAMERA ‚Äì It has a 720p FaceTime HD camera, I do not use such feature so I cannot say much about the in-depth details.üëç  BLUETOOTH ‚Äì It connects my Logitech K380 and Logitech M235 both Bluetooth device instantly without installing any driver. I also tried Bluetooth headphone, and it connects as well.üëç  EXTERNAL ‚Äì I connected AOC monitor from Thunderbolt to VGA adapter to extend the display, suitable for my job.üëç  SUPPORT ‚Äì It comes with one-year international warranty including online support and one year Apple protection plan.üëç  GAMING - Sorry, I don't play games on Mac, I have a monster desktop to fulfill my requirement lol. I have seen most of the modern games run smoothly on MAC but to be noted. MacBook is not for gaming purpose.üëç  BUY ONLINE ‚Äì Showroom price is 15k more than online pricing, and they started arguing about the duplicate/counterfeit parts, but this is not true, Amazon price is very low, and you save more bucks with warranty.========================üòûüòûüòû  Cons: üòûüòûüòûüëé  Only 128GB SSD is not enough, and I need to attach external HDD to store data.üëé  No CD drive so have to use the pen drive.üëé  No HDMI port, have to use Thunderbolt to HDMI adapterüëé  No Internet on-off function key, have to use default OS.üëé  The first word is ""i"" so every accessory for it is expensive, better is to find third-party accessories to save bucks.üëé  Apple Protection Plan is along cost Rs15000-18000k for two years for MacBook Air.Have any questions regarding the MacBook Air, ask me. üëç"

2063,5.0 stars,"  I like this ###I like to use apple products so i picked MacBook Air and used. TheMacBook Air is last up to 12 hours between charges , you can work unplugged. The ssd storage in MacBook Air is up to 7x faster than a 5400 rpm in notebook hard drive.So from your morning coffee to your evening commute, you can work unplugged. When it‚Äôs time to kick back and relax, you can get up to 12 hours of iTunes movie playback. And with up to 30 days of standby time, you can go away for weeks and pick up where you left off.Whatever the task, fifth-generation Intel Core i5 and i7 processors with Intel HD Graphics 6000 are up to it. From editing photos to browsing the web, everything happens ultra-fast. And all that power is encased in an incredibly thin 1.7-centimetre unibody design that weighs only 1.35 kilos.Instantly connect to an 802.11ac base station ‚Äî including AirPort Extreme or AirPort Time Capsule ‚Äî and experience wireless performance up to three times faster than the previous Wi-Fi generation. 802.11ac also delivers expanded range, so you can work more freely than ever.macOS is the operating system that powers everything you do on a Mac. macOS High Sierra brings new forward‚Äëlooking technologies and enhanced features to your Mac. It‚Äôs macOS at its highest level yet.Features & details:All new 2017 Apple MacBook Air1.8GHz Intel Core i5 processor8GB LPDDR3 RAM, 128GB Solid State hard drive13.3-inch screen, Intel HD Graphics 6000MacOS Sierra operating system1.35kg laptop1440x900 pixels per inch with support for millions of colors, 720p FaceTime HD camera1 year warranty from manufacturer from date of purchase"
2064,1.0 stars,  I had a very bad experience with apple mac book. It has very very bad service support.  One fine day I shut down my macbook but it didn't switched on next morning.  I took it to the service centre and they told they will charge 46 thousand rupees to repair it. My macbook was only 2 year old . I'm feeling cheated by apple.Think 100 times before buying apple products. If any problem comes after warranty period then apple products can't be repaired . it's better to buy a new one instead of repairing at this huge cost.

2080,5.0 stars,"  I have been a Macbook pro user for last 2 years. I came across the new Macbook air and got a chance to put hands on it. So here is a brief review on my first impressions. Basically i will be comparing this with a regular laptop of similar price range and Macbook PROAir benefits compared to Non Apple laptop:# Slim and light weight for daily travel# 10-11 hours battery backup on normal usage# Apple touch pads are awesome, smooth and responsive compared to any premium laptop# Audio quality on speakers is good, but not as loud as my Macbook Pro 13# Apple front camera works the best in low light, best for low light skype calls# SSD - Apps launch very fast despite the low power processor# Metal body construction# Mag safe charger- If you are really careless this helps very much.# Ambient light sensor that adjusts brightness automatically ( Many people are not aware of this feature)# Keep your Air closed or leave somewhere idle and check back after 2 or 3 days, you will see battery has dropped less than 3 or 4 %# The best part - Mac OS, contains all that you need, a neat calendar, Todos app, notes, Quicktime, Mail app etc. Hassle free OSAir demerits compared to Non Apple laptop:# Performance is on lower side# Good for basic usage only, internet, movies, video calls, spreadsheets, mail# You will get better display(Full HD) if you buy a 999$ Ultrabook from US (In India they come at premium)Should you consider Macbook PRO? - PRO advantagesI know a lot of people might be confused whether to go with PRO for some additional bucks. So listing benefits of pro from my experience# Force touch - More comfortable touch pad, less finger pain compared to buttons on Air, Adjustable pressure# Retina display - More pixels, Better viewing angle. Air is 1440x900 while PRO is 2560x1600 pixels# Better performance - Pro CPU is actually about 50% faster than AIR, but in real world tests, apps launch at similar speed in both PRO and Air. The difference is notable only when you run CPU intensive tasks like Programming, Video encoding, Photo editing, Raw conversion etc. Those who are not into this can go with Air and save some money.# Newer CPU - Macbook air has not evolved much compared to PRO. The 2017 Air uses the same fifth generation CPU as the previous version (2015). But with a little upgrade in CPU speed. ie 1.6 GHz to 1.8 GHz. The newer PROs come with 7th generation Intel processors. The difference is mainly with the energy consumption.# HDMI port - You don't need display port adaptor# New keyboard - The 2016 PRO has the same keyboard as the ""Macbook"". Keys are less deeper and more wider. This makes it little more comfortable to type. Air comes with the same old keyboard as 2015 PRO# Wider touch pad - Not a big deal. But if someone loves that, its a bonus# Color options - Yes, Air is only available in Silver, PRO comes in 3 color optionsIf you think, all the above justifies the price difference between the PRO and Air, go for the PRO. The only benefit that Air offers is battery life. PRO offers 8-9 hours only, while Air offers, 11-12 hours battery.Whom Air is for?Macbook air is not a gaming machine or for hard core users. Its for people who love to watch lot of movies, work on documents, browse and some basic programming. When i say programming, Xcode works fine on Macbook air. But Software like Android studio, Photoshop seems to struggle a little on Air. But if you are once in a while user of intensive apps, you can ignore this.I will update my review with more details after a few weeks of hands on testing and usage. If you have any queries leave a comment below. I will try to answer in a day or two."

2085,2.0 stars,"  After one year of use, I am not getting anywhere near the 10-12 hours of use. At the most 2-3 hours. Battery life was the only reason. I bought this (2016 version) but terribly disappointed. My workload is VirtualBox, Chrome, Quickbooks, Trello. If battery life means a lot to you, perhaps the Macbook Pro is the better choice."

2095,5.0 stars,"  Eagerly wanted this, amazing product!!!"
2096,4.0 stars,  I have seen this every where people saying that macbook air doesn‚Äôt give a full hd display even in the 2017 model.practically guys that‚Äôs not a thing that should make you change your mind of buying this laptop. Coz this thing is beauty with the beastt!!! TRUST MEE
2097,5.0 stars,"  It's a good product. Extremely satisfied with the purchase. There is certainly a class about the product.But the prices are falling like nine pins.MRP is 77200. I bought it for 64k in the first week of Aug. I was feeling happy because prices had come down by almost 7-8 thousand in the past one month (i.e. Jul to Aug). However, today, further down a month, price is around 55k.With the festive season around the corner, prices will fall down further. There is no stability in the price of the product.Those who are planning to buy it, should plan it around sale time which is around the corner."
2098,4.0 stars,  Over all its awesome... The screen it's just ok. but if your roommate or someone near you uses MacBook Pro with Retina display (sadly my roommate has MacBook Pro)haha. The screen will kinda let you down.If its for school or college works... you can't ask for a better one. But feel free to go for new MacBook Pro if money is not the issue.lol

2107,3.0 stars,  if you are investing 57k in Mac then you should be prepared for extra 35k because there are some issues with Mac air book logic board like frequently shutting down if this happens with you're Mac air after warranty then the original Mac air logic board cost 35k. Better you should buy additional apple warranty to avoid such expensive hardware issue otherwise Mac book air is a fantastic machine
2108,5.0 stars,"  Nice laptop but it is costly according to the specs. Screen quality is nice , viewing angles are just ok and battery life is amazing can use laptop for 6-7 on a single charge. But it is not meant for gaming according to the price it should but I didn't because of the old processor"

2117,4.0 stars,"  I am writing this review post one year use. ProsThe laptop looks great. Design is impeccable. Light as air. Carrying is very easy. Battery back up and charging speed are excellent. Short cuts, use of track pad, fast processing are some really great features.ConsNot at all for gamers. Most of the apps like MS office are difficult to run and need to be bought. Though inbuilt apps for mac are there for all ms office apps but they are not used as their functions are different. Lacks number pad. And those who are shifting from the windows will find that nothing like IDM is there. Storage is another issue.So if you are a working professional who travels a lot, buy it before thinking twice. Otherwise windows is also great and that too at a very low price when compared."

2119,5.0 stars,"  I‚Äôve been using this laptop from past 5 months now. This is still one of the finest laptops available in the market. Brilliant battery, good display, awesome keyboard, super thin."
2120,1.0 stars,"  I have got the Mac from Amazon and i feel really sad buying such an expensive product online. There has been a lot of hardware issues on my system. If this is the case with reputed brands like Apple, i have no idea on what is the status of the other brands. I really lost the trust on buying expensive products on Amazon or online now."

2122,5.0 stars,"  Macbook Air 2017 Specs:* 13.2-inch, 1,440-x-900-pixel display.* 8GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor with 3MB shared L3 cache (Turbo Boost up to 2.9GHz).* 8GB of 1,600MHz LPDDR3 RAM, 128GB PCIe-based flash storage.* Intel HD Graphics 6000.* 720p FaceTime HD camera.* Full-size backlit keyboard with Ambient light sensor, and Multi-Touch trackpad.* 54-watt-hour battery.* Stereo speakers, Dual microphones.* Ports: 2 x USB 3; 1 x Thunderbolt 2; 1 x SDXC card slot; 1 x 3.5mm headphone jack.* Weight : 1.35kg.* Operating System : MacOS Sierra.* Connectivity :  802.11ac Wi-Fi networking; IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n compatible; Bluetooth 4.0 wireless technologyVerdict:* The design has not changed for the past five years, which is a shame. The MacBook Air's aluminium unibody design, which supports the main enclosure and the display, is as durable as ever and still really light and really well-constructed.* The 2017 model‚Äôs Intel Core i5 processor gets a small speed bump from 1.6GHz to 1.8GHz (which can be pushed to 2.9GHz). And uses the same Intel HD Graphics 6000 chip.* We get a Standard 128GB Solid State hard drive which is a good thing, and 8GB LPDDR3 RAM.* The MacBook Air‚Äôs screen is a 13.3-inch (diagonal) LED-backlit glossy widescreen display with a resolution of 1,440-x-900 pixels and a pixel density of roughly 128ppi.* Software pre-installed on the Laptop: Photos; iMovie; GarageBand; Pages; Numbers; Keynote; Siri, Safari; Mail; FaceTime; Messages; Maps; Notes; Calendar; Contacts; Reminders; Photo Booth; Preview; iTunes; iBooks; App Store; and Time Machine (backup).* And Finally the best part of MacBook Air 2017 is its battery life, is as good as the previous model or it last longer than the previous ones.If you are looking for a different OS like this one is from Apple which operating system is MacOS Sierra and moving on from Windows operating system you definitely should get this lowest price from Apple. But, if you are coming from your Old Macbook air (Previous Model) and thinking of upgrading, you should stick with your Old Macbook. Because nothing much changed from the last year model.What I really love about this laptop is, it is still the best MacBook Air for its design, price, size, and features."
2123,5.0 stars,  Make it cheaper again.Pls.Pretty pls.
2124,1.0 stars,  Please don't purchase it online. Especially from the vendor IT sales. I don't understand what to do with this bin. Its been only a year and a half. Initially I started facing issues with power. It just keeps on shutting down in between the work. Then then it finally stopped working. I have shown it to the premium service store of apple. They found out that there was a issue with the motherboard and needs to be replaced by paying 45k. Wtf. Please if you are planning to spend huge amount of money on something like this. Do it wisely.

2134,3.0 stars,"  I have used both Win and mac in my life, and i gonna be honest i prefer wondows. Windows is more user friendly than mac for me . It's price is a bit high for the specs, i mean you can get a qay more powerful laptop in 50k and if you are a gamer don't even think of getting a mac. Ofcourse you get much better battery life than windows , about 12 hrs of battery . So i only suggest you to go for mac if you are a office worker or business man and you work in a place where there is no place to plug in your laptop to charge it. And yeah it is light weight too. And 8 gb ddr3 RAM is slow. You can get 8 gb ddr4 RAM  in Windows in that price which will me way more faster than this ."

2150,2.0 stars,  Do not buy products from Apple thinking the build quality to be premium. My MacBook Air's keyboard and trackpad stopped working after one year of use. I am not the only person with this problem. You can find many forum posts on this problem. The apple employees charge a hefty amount for any repairment.
2151,1.0 stars,  I have tried to start this MacBook as soon as I have received from amazon courier person . From last 3 hours I am not able to cross Welcome screen .. astonished and I am thinking hopefully I have been not fooled
2152,1.0 stars,  Compare to other laptops in this price rangeProns1) if you are blind mac lover then go for this laptop.2) laptop is very slim easy to carry.Cons1) Display is not good. Compare to my old dell laptop display looks dim and weak.2) outdated processor. It comes with dual core i5. You will feel laptop is working smooth but after 2 years laptop will lag.3) 8 Gb ram is not sufficient for programming Purpose. You can not use this laptop for gaming.Why should you buy MacBook just to watch movie.4) only 128 gb ssd. You have to carry external  hard drive everywhere with this mac.5) lack of port. You have to purchase and carry adapter inorder to connect HDMI or VGA
2153,2.0 stars,"  Okay, so I bought this machine thinking it would give me a Kaby-lake chip (7th Gen), but to my surprise it was a old Broadwell chip (5th gen).The 900p screen is poor, inaccurate and bad at best. The SSD is slower than consumer level NVMe SSDs.Swapped it out for a HP Envy 13. Twice the storage and faster NVMe interface rather than flash. Kaby-lake refresh chip (8th Gen Quad-core), and a FHD IPS panel, and saving 2200 rupees as well to buy a USB-C adaptor."

2158,1.0 stars,"  Before buying this piece of crap give a thought what you'll be getting at this price....5th gen i5, with only 128gb ssd, 1440√ó900 TN panel....for instance one can get Asus, HP or DELL with an i5 8th gen processor and Full HD display.Now someone might say you are getting a mac it doesn't requires too much horsepower...TRUE...but in the end you are getting a processor which is almost 4 years old now and a screen which is worse than those 20k laptops from other brands and isn't any good for anything...put a similar priced windows next to it and you'll understand the difference...and remember you can't upgrade the RAM as those are soldered.... And if you are considering this laptop for content creation then you are  in big trouble...cuz the processor is not that powerful....so ifsoyou are ready pay 58k just for the sake of that apple logo...only then go for it...but frankly this isn't worth  that money"

2160,5.0 stars,  HOW R U GUYS GETTING IT FOR 43500
2161,4.0 stars,"  I have been using my windows laptop for the past 4 years and now I decided to switch to apple. So now when I got the new  MacBook air ,I thought to write a review to describe how it's experience is to me. The MacBook Air remains the least expensive MacBook, and has finally received a minor spec upgrade. Battery life is excellent, and performance for everyday tasks remains smooth. It's the only MacBook left with standard USB ports.But the design feels dated, with a thick bezel around a low-resolution screen. Windows laptops in the same price range offer newer components, higher-res screens and lighter, slimmer bodies.The MacBook Air lives to fight another day, thanks to its mainstream price and long battery life, but this classic laptop is definitely in its twilight."
2162,3.0 stars,  Is the storage 128 gb only is sufficient for laptops user ???

2165,5.0 stars,"  HEY GUYS.THIS IS THE DETAILED REVIEW OFAPPLE MACBOOK AIR MQD32HN/A ULTRABOOK (CORE I5 5TH GEN/8 GB/128 GB SSD/MACOS SIERRA) (IN DEPTH).SO PACK YOUR GEARS AND ENJOY IT.....!!!!Apple MacBook Air MQD32HN/A Ultrabook (Core i5 5th Gen/8 GB/128 GB SSD/macOS Sierra) laptop has a display for your daily needs. This laptop is powered by processor, coupled with 8 GB GB of RAM and has 128 GB SSD storage at this price point. As far as the graphics card is concerned this notebook has graphics card to manage the graphical functions. To keep it alive, it has a battery and weighs .In June 2017 Apple updated the processor on its 13in MacBook Air from 1.6GHz to 1.8GHz - not a massive improvement as the processor is the same generation as the MacBook Air used when it was last significantly updated in 2015 - but the MacBook Air remains a great choice for an entry-level Mac laptop.The MacBook Air is the laptop you see in coffee shops, libraries, offices, and student digs all over the world. Apple might have forgotten it in favour of the sharper-screened 13in and 15in MacBook Pro and dinkier 12in MacBook, but the masses still love the lightweight, entry-level Air.Apple isn‚Äôt calling its most recent MacBook Air update a ‚Äúnew‚Äù model, but to distinguish it from its otherwise very similar Early-2015 MacBook Air we‚Äôll call it the Mid-2017 MacBook Air.Apple hasn‚Äôt changed the Air much at all since it wowed the laptop world in 2010 with its sharp, wedge-shaped case ‚Äì which still looks great, in our opinion. There were some minor processor and port changes in 2015, but since then the only real updates have been upticks on the processor speed and a welcome doubling of the default memory (from 4GB to 8GB).It‚Äôs still available in just the one silvery colour, unlike the 12in MacBook (Silver, Space Grey, Gold, or Rose Gold) or 13in or 15in MacBook Pro (Silver or Space Grey).MacBook Air 2017: processor, graphics and RAM2017‚Äôs changes are limited to the slightly faster processor. Everything else remains the same from the most recent 2015 model, which used the same Intel ‚ÄúBroadwell‚Äù processor as the 2017 Air.MacBook Pro models have used later ‚ÄúSkylake‚Äù and most up-to-date ‚ÄúKaby Lake‚Äù processors, so if you need the fastest speeds from a Mac laptop you should look to the Pro range (from 2.3GHz to 3.6GHz chip speeds).That said, for most of us, with our browsing, streaming, social and office needs the MacBook Air should be fast enough.The 2017 model‚Äôs Intel Core i5 processor gets a small speed bump from 1.6GHz to 1.8GHz. When we‚Äôve speed tested the new Air we‚Äôll let you know what that does to performance, but we can say for sure that it wouldn‚Äôt be worth upgrading from the 2015 model to the 2017 Air.If your Air is older than the 2015 model - and you still love the form factor - then an upgrade might be worthwhile. You‚Äôll also get faster graphics (the 2017 Air uses the same Intel HD Graphics 6000 chip, which replaced the 2014 Air‚Äôs HD Graphics 5000), and 8GB RAM as standard.When buying the new Air you can upgrade to a 2.2GHz Intel Core i7 processor.Apple also offers a feature called Turbo Boost. In technical terms this over-clocks the processor to push to greater speeds. If enough power is available and the temperature is at a safe level Turbo Boost will 'over-clock' the core and enable it to work faster. The standard 1.8GHz i5 processor can be pushed to 2.9GHz. The custom option 2.2GHz i7 processor can reach 3.2GHz via Turbo Boost.Basically, you should go for the fastest processor if you want, and if possible Turbo Boost will push it as far as it can. But remember that if speed is really vital to you, you should look to the MacBook Pro range.MacBook Air 2017: storageThe only difference between the two MacBook Airs you can buy in 2017 is the storage capacity. In the old days we‚Äôd have called this the ‚Äúhard disk‚Äù but the Air has always boasted much-faster ‚Äúsolid-state‚Äù SDD drives.The choice you get (as standard) is either 128GB or 256GB, but you can also double the maximum on-board storage to 512GB for ¬£150 ($200).We‚Äôd recommend you go for as much storage as you can afford if you plan on storing music, images or video. But if your laptop is used mainly for browsing and light document work the 128GB should suffice.MacBook Air 2017: ports and slotsThe new Air features the same side ports as the 2015 model. You get:Two USB 3 ports (up to 5Gbps) for the usual peripherals.One Thunderbolt 2 port (up to 20Gbps) for adding a larger display or faster external hard drive.MagSafe 2 power port ‚Äì still the best in our opinion, and much missed on the newer 12in MacBook, which uses its single USB-C (Thunderbolt 3) port for power and peripherals, and so requires a ¬£69 ($69) Multiport Adapter if you need more than one at a time.SDXC camera card slot5mm headphone jackIf you have lots of standard USB peripherals then the Air supports these out of the box. The MacBook and MacBook Pro models require newer USB-C accessories or ¬£19 ($19) adapters.It boasts the same great 802.11ac Wi-Fi standards (IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n compatible) as the top-of-the-range MacBook Pro.MacBook Air 2017: screenThe MacBook Air‚Äôs screen is a 13.3in (diagonal) LED-backlit glossy widescreen display with a resolution of 1,440-x-900 pixels and a pixel density of roughly 128ppi (pixels per inch).It‚Äôs not as crisp and smooth as the Retina screen you‚Äôll find on the MacBook or Pro models. http://www.macworld.co.uk/feature/apple/what-retina-hd-display-are-they-worth-money-apple-3466732/In comparison, the 13in Retina MacBook Pro has a 2,560-x-1,600 native resolution at 227ppi.The Air‚Äôs display isn‚Äôt a bad screen, but Pro users might find it a little fuzzy in comparison to the Retina. The Air screen does use less power, though, and contributes to the lower overall cost.MacBook Air 2017: priceThe MacBook Air is the cheapest new Mac laptop you can buy, starting at ¬£949/US$949 for the 128GB model. The 256GB Air is priced at ¬£1,099/$1,199 ‚Äì so you pay an extra ¬£150/$200 for the larger capacity. Add a further ¬£150/$200 and you get 512GB of storage in the custom build option.The 8GB of RAM isn‚Äôt upgradeable, but the processor is, as explained above: pay ¬£135/$150 more for the 2.2GHz i7 processorMacBook Air 2017: installed software and appsYou get a ton of great Apple apps, including the likes of FaceTime for free video calls with other Apple devices, and the office apps (Numbers spreadsheet, Pages page layout, and Keynote presentations), plus photo archiving, movie making and music making and listening apps.Photos; iMovie; GarageBand; Pages; Numbers; Keynote; Siri, Safari; Mail; FaceTime; Messages; Maps; Notes; Calendar; Contacts; Reminders; Photo Booth; Preview; iTunes; iBooks; App Store; and Time Machine (backup).MacBook Air 2017: specs8GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor with 3MB shared L3 cache (Turbo Boost up to 2.9GHz); with custom option of 2.2GHz Intel Core i7 processor (Turbo Boost up to 3.2GHz).8GB of 1,600MHz LPDDR3 RAM128GB, 256GB or 512GB PCIe-based flash storage3in, 1,440-x-900-pixel displayIntel HD Graphics 600011ac Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n compatible); Bluetooth 4.0Ports: 2 x USB 3; 1 x Thunderbolt 2; 1 x SDXC card slot; 1 x 3.5mm headphone jackStereo speakersDual microphones720p FaceTime HD cameraFull-size backlit keyboard with Ambient light sensor, and Multi-Touch trackpad54-watt-hour battery: Up to 12 hours wireless web browsing (claimed)Dimensions:Height: 0.3-1.7cm (0.11-0.68in)Width: 32.5cm (12.8in)Depth: 22.7cm (8.94in)Height: 1.35kg (2.96lb)For buying advice related to the current Apple laptop range, read our Best MacBook buying guide and Best cheap MacBook deals articles. You can also see our one-stop guide to the best place to buy any Mac.OUR VERDICTThe 13-inch MacBook Air is Apple‚Äôs entry-level laptop, starting at ¬£949 (US$999). It might lack the super-sharp Retina screen of the Macbook and MacBook Pro models but its display and performance is fine for most everyday uses. It boasts enough USB ports and other slots to make it more useful out of the box than the more limited, USB-C-only 12-inch MacBook or Pro. And its Wi-Fi is the same high standard as even the top-of-the-range MacBook Pro. If you need raw power go for the Pro. If you need the smallest Mac laptop there is, look at the 12-inch MacBook. But, all in all, despite it not changing much year after year we still love the MacBook Air for its design, price, size and features.THANKS FOR READING THIS FULL ARTICLE FOR FURTHER INFORMATION YOU CAN VISIT ON OUR CHANNEL ""TECH HARSH TALKS"" THANKS (ONCE AGAIN)."

2168,2.0 stars,"  Don't buy mac. Amazon did a good job, but mac sucks. Hardware is premium, works good. But you can run Linux or Windows perfectly on this machine due to compatibility issues. Not productive, Windows is much better. You will feel even little features are missing, not expected from apple. Apple should take tutions from Windows or Linux. Apple don't care about what people want, they design machines according to them. Where Windows listen to their customer feedback and works on it. Well im a full stack developer and people says mac = developer. Really??? This is 2018, things changed."

2180,2.0 stars,"  This is a over-hyped product; plz don't go for this overly simple yet complex machine. I don't find any advantage after using it for a month now; I face problems while working on MS Office - Word, Excel, PPT, etc.; not at all user friendly interface. Other normal features for a normal Indian are also not there.So plz avoid buying it, if you are actually clear as to why you are going for it; not just because it is apple, a bitten one."

2195,5.0 stars,"  It‚Äôs still better compared to the newer laptops available from other brands. I don‚Äôt understand people who try to advise others and stop them from buying this beautiful laptop. Just because they can‚Äôt use the OS for whatever reason doesn‚Äôt mean others can‚Äôt! Someone said changing the cursor is the hardest in one of the reviews! I mean just because u can‚Äôt use a premium laptop or its ur first apple product, don‚Äôt discourage others and post negative reviews. This laptop is sleek, light and very easy to use. Yes it‚Äôs different to windows but it‚Äôs easy to get used to. If your budget is in this range then go for it because it still packs a punch even though it‚Äôs a 5th gen processor."
2196,5.0 stars,"  The best laptop ...I am already using Mac book pro 13"" and wanna take another Mac book for my portable use...Air is very lite weight and easy to use...As Mac books are costly and near 1 lakh its better to go wit this Mac book Air... if you really want to use Apple laptop"
