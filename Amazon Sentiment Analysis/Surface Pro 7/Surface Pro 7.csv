0,4.0 stars,"  Pros:• USB-C, Finally! As a past Surface Pro user, this was never a feature. With a USB-C, like any computer, you can do so much more with this device now. From headphones to connecting external 4k monitors, to charging this and other devices (USB-C chargers are 10x cheaper to get), to even connecting an Ethernet adaptor. About time Microsoft.• It’s a very sold machine. I go no flex issues, the frame feels sturdy, and overall I felt that I can throw this in a bag and not worry.• It’s light. Not IPad light, but enough that you won’t feel worried that you’re not going to bend it.• The microphone set up on the Pro is a big upgrade. Skype calls from my parents came crisp and clear in an indoor, TV on, volume. The web video is what it is, but the microphone setup is a thumbs up.• Cortana listens to you pretty well. I’m learning Spanish so translating even simple questions, from English to Spanish, Cortana does a lot better than either using Alexa or Google Assistant. Also questions about directions, weather, and others were spot on.• Excellent display. The screen is bright, outstanding saturation/color balance, and also offers ambient light sensing when it gets dark. When you go to settings you can modify it for a specific time, or it will automatically adjust when the sun goes down in your location.• Microsoft mastered the kickstand on this. Numerous ranges of all angels, and is even quite steady when it’s placed on my lap.• microSD reader (for upgraded memory option)• Headphone Jack. I find this feature a must if you’re planning to edit videos on this.• Solid State Drive (SDD) on a tablet size is one of the best things. If you have to choose, always an SSD, regardless of memory size. Faster, cooler, and• Charging on this is very fast. From 0 to 50% it took around 45-50 minutes. Note that I was using the charging cords that it came with. Don’t expect the same results when using an off-brand.• A lot of horsepower for a tablet. Inside is an Ice Lake processor. To summarize, it features smaller transistors that makes multi-tasking an non-issue. Trying out for the first time with around 10 apps running (Madden, Netflix, Live Maps, Grand Trims Mo, etc.), the machine had no lag or hiccups. Largely the effects of this chip will be appreciated in the next 2 years from when you get this tablet.• The processor allows Wi-Fi 6 to be enforced on this tablet. This area is still new but within the next year, this tablet will already be up to date with the hardware. Meaning stronger upload and download rates.• The speakers shoot sound directly to my face. Turning on Spotify, I got a decent quality in sound. With rock and country, I got a very balanced, and a lot of power in the volume. For the average listener it’s quite good. Not IPad level but still good to make the list.• I can see the 3:2 screen a benefit for those who want to read, show notes, and display documents at work. Not many tablets can provide this without losing some quality. For me, I saw no waste in this Surface.Cons and Oks:• The chunky bezel. Stick to the times Microsoft, this can’t be ignored in 2019. It’s very thick and with competitors providing bezel-less frames, or close to it, this is a major turn off (Not to mention that Microsoft itself has a Surface Pro X with a design that is significantly less in the bezel. (Why not this one?).• With the bezel issue, the screen size makes the tablet look 2 years older than what it is.• Last year's model and this one are 99% the same in design. Remove the USB-C connector and it’ll be 100% the same. A very outdated design as I think Microsoft invested all their money on the internals and just forgot about the redesigning.• The battery life isn’t great. I’m getting around 8 hours of power. That’s having Wi-Fi always on, web surfing, daily YouTube playing, and a couple of hours with Netflix (plus a couple of smaller apps). It can last a whole day if you control your power and your screen display, but it’s nowhere near what Microsoft is saying.• Don’t take it outside on a sunny day. That sun glare is too powerful for this display brightness.• Keyboard and Surface Pen are sold separately. I didn’t test these as you only get the tablet.• Even though USB-C is a great thing to have, we’re already in the USB 3.1 world. With also no Thunderbolt 3 (quick file transfer) I wish that Microsoft put more effort into the outside design as much as they put in there hardware on this machine.• I found no issue playing Overwatch on this but trying to play Call of Duty forget it. This isn’t for deep gaming and playing Overwatch killed a decent chunk of the battery.Bottom Line:If you’re going to buy this, you need to at least invest in there keyboard cover. It’s disappointing that to fully experience your Pro, you need to put down money on its keyboard and pen. Without a keyboard, from my experience, you’re pretty limited. I used a Logitech Bluetooth keyboard and mouse, but the portably is limited if you can’t attach them to the Surface Pro.Also we're in the age of laptops, tablets, and phones trying to reach the goal to be bezel-less.  I have the previous model on hand and I can’t tell them apart in any way. Thanks to these 2019 new laptops/tablets, the bezels on this device make it feel like this tablet is from 2017. I’m also irritated that Microsoft didn’t at least try to improve the design.But if you can deal with the design (and the battery) issues, you’ll know that Microsoft put all their money on what’s inside the system. From the new core processors, this tablet is a beast. I found it very fast, reliable, and it will stand its ground for 2+ years. For me that’s the beauty of a Surface Pro: a PC in the size of a tablet. I’m always a PC fan and this performs as if I had a laptop on my lap, something an IPad can’t do. If you can deal with the generic bezel look, and put money down for their keyboard, you’re getting a beast of a computer fitting in a tablet.Overall: An outdated design that packs a lot of power for those who want more than just a generic tablet on the go.Hope I was a help to you.Love,Honest Reviewer"
1,2.0 stars,"  Comparing Dell XPS 13, Lenovo Yoga C940 14 and Surface Pro 7 2-in-1's all with i7-1065G7 CPU/GPU.[SP7 PROS:]-Best 3:2 aspect ratio is better for productivity (but screen is uncomfortably small) > XPS 16:10 > Yoga 16:9-IR camera for Windows Hello face sign-in, though not useful when docked or when screen is not at the correct angle-Least weight 2.4 lbs > 3 lbs for others-Quietest fan > Yoga > XPS (loudest)[SP7 CONS:]-Worst battery life (even worse than SP6)-Smallest 12.3"" display with thick bezels-No 4K UHD option (but I recommend FHD with any brand/model for battery life, you can always dock to a larger monitor)-No Thunderbolt 3 with PD/DP (no eGPU)-Keyboard and pen sold separately[XPS PROS:]-Up to 32GB RAM > 16GB on others-Slimmest-Fingerprint reader on power button > Yoga on palmrest > SP7 on non-included $160 Type Cover with Fingerprint ID[XPS CONS:]-No USB-A (deal breaker for me)-No black exterior option. The white interior option keyboard is hard to see with the white backlighting-No far field microphones for Alexa or other assistants-Included charger is only 45W (less than 65W with Yoga/SP7)[YOGA PROS:]-Best screen-to-body ratio (89%) > XPS 84.9% > SP7 76.76%; although the hinge factors into this-Largest screen 14"" > XPS 13.4"" > SP7 12.3""-Deepest key travel, most comfortable keyboard > XPS > SP7-Better Arrow Keys + Home/End/Pg Up/Pg Down layout-INCLUDED garaged pen with internal charging > magnetically attached and not included with purchase on others-Best in class speakers. Rotating soundbar with Dolby Atmos sounds amazing! Gets loud!-Built-in camera shutter-Coolest under heavy load > SP7 gets warm > XPS hottest-Fastest Rapid charge (2 hours in 15 minutes)-Largest 65 WHr battery > XPS 51 WHr > SP7 45 WHr[YOGA CONS:]-Shortest 16:9 aspect ratio with large ""chin"" bezel at bottom of screen face-No MicroSD slot compared to others-Anti-glare customizable option no longer available[CONS OF ALL:]-No HDMI-No dedicated GPU option, though Thunderbolt 3 on XPS and Yoga allows external GPUs for gaming. Not available on SP7. eGPU great for gaming, allows modular upgradability of graphics cards in the future, although they lose ~20% FPS compared to PCIe.[PRICING:]For i7, 16GB, 512GB with Windows 10 Home:YOGA 4K $1785 > XPS 4K + pen $1900 > SP7 FHD + type cover + pen $2160[CONCLUSION:]The SP7 was the most expensive when you add the keyboard and pen. The XPS FHD with 32GB RAM came in at $1730. I would like to see a 32GB 4K 512GB option since I don't need that much on-device storage.All have performance improvements over their predecessors thanks to the new 10th gen Intel i7 processors, LPDDR4x RAM and WiFi 6. The Surface Book 2 is too dated to compare here and is clunkier.It's a toss up between the XPS for its 32GB RAM with taller screen, or the Yoga with its USB-A port, better keyboard, and garaged pen, among other things. The extra RAM comes in useful since the integrated graphics will use some of that. The 16GB models easily ran up to 80% CPU, RAM and GPU when driving 2 external monitors and simultaneously running Chrome with tabs, Office apps, iTunes and light gaming. It often sits at 8GB RAM under normal use.Some may appreciate all the ports being on one side as with the Yoga, or having ports on either side as with the XPS. The dedicated volume rockers on the SP7 comes in handy. The lighter weight of the SP7 made it the first to be grabbed on the go for content consumption or note taking, but I prefer the Yoga for content creation with it's larger screen and comfy keyboard. If you're docking all day and only occasionally need to be on the go then I recommend the XPS for its 32GB RAM. The perfect laptop is not quite here yet."
2,5.0 stars,"  I'm seeing complaints about how this isn't a major redesign of the Pro 6. That may be true, but the internals are where it's at. I mean, I love this thing. It's like having a decently powerful desktop PC in the form factor of a tablet, which can quickly become a laptop. For instance, I installed an Xbox Game Pass game (Ori and the Blind Forest) and it ran amazingly smooth; I had no idea a 12 inch tablet could run a game with Xbox One-quality graphics even in 2019. Sure, it's not gonna run Gears 5 in 4K, but how many tablets can say they can run even a game like Ori at decent settings?People keep saying ""it's just like the Pro 6 but with a USB-C connector!"" But it's been confirmed by multiple sources that the Pro 7's i5 processor is better than the Pro 6's i7 processor. And yeah, having a USB-C connector is pretty nice.Yes, the bezels are slightly thicker than most 2019 phones and tablets, but it's a non-issue for me. I use the Surface in tablet mode and it would be incredibly annoying to accidentally touch things on the screen because there's nowhere to put my hands for the sake of A E S T H E T I C S. It's a silly complaint, in my opinion.I'm a grad student, so I need to be able to plop down anywhere -- the library, a cafe, my mom's house, a friend's house, wherever -- and get work done in a way that my phone simply isn't right for. But I also want to be able to stream movies, edit videos, play videogames, and so on. So far, the Surface Pro 7 has done everything I want and more.Literally the only bummer is that Microsoft STILL isn't bundling the type cover in with the tablet. Springing an extra $150 for something that feels like an essential part of the package is a huge bummer. I wish they could figure out a way to include the type cover, even if they have to make some compromises."
3,1.0 stars,"  Purchased this item trying to make sure I got the right item and non-defective so I went with the one sold by Amazon.com. I opened it and started filling out all my information, applying a screen protector and all of this for nothing but madness. I wasted many hours out of my day just to end up returning this item. This was actually labeled with a label printer as Surface Pro 7 on the box but I wanted to make sure I got the right product which I didn't! I actually got a Surface Pro 6. I did not know if this was an intentional scam for all customers or I just had a fluke. Anyways here are the pictures and now I'll be exchanging the item for this same exact one... I mean an actual Surface Pro 7. MAKE SURE TO CHECK YOUR MODEL ONCE YOU RECEIVE THIS ITEM!"
4,1.0 stars,"  Is not a surface pro 7, is not intel core i5, doesn’t have type c port, doesn’t have 8 Gb ram.....I feel cheated!!!! I need a explanation and my money back"
5,1.0 stars,"  Well where do i start..... i ended up getting my item and everything was good for about 20mins of use... however after 20mins my screen would freeze for 10-30 secs. I blew it off at first but then it happen 10mins after then it became a often issue. So i ended up going for an exchange. (The worst idea I’ve ever had). I called up amazon and told them my issue and they were quick to get me a replacement so as first i was satisfied until the surface pro 7 came in the next day. I open the box to find out the box it comes in is not only damage but in a renewed box didn’t even come in the same box it should have come in, then i open that to see the surface pro and the screen film wrapped around it was really dirty as if they dropped it in dirt or so and fingerprints all over the machine. So at this point I’m just hoping it works. This one was not charged at all at 15% like it usually is if you were to buy from Microsoft or an apple device would normally be. So i put it on the charger to find out that it not only has screen tear straight down the middle of the screen but a big red dot half the size of the screen was on there as if they drop the surface pro. So at this point i immediately call amazon and i talked to a representative that ended up giving me a hard time about another replacement even though this one was obviously there fault. So i ended up talking to a supervisor that ended up giving me a hard time as well and in the she said to me that they only do a exchange once but as a one time exception they’ll do the exchange to which i responded with i only want to do the exchange if it’s a brand new product that they are giving me not a renewed one and undamaged. To which she agreed that she would make sure it would be done and put in her notes so the wear house  knows. Well the next day came and guess what.... the man that drops it off throws my package at the wall of my house from a big distance he didn’t see me at all so when i raced over the man jumped in his car and quickly drove away knowing what he did. Not only this but when i open the box the surface pro again was in a dirty renewed box, at this point I’m just hoping it still even worked again no power so i plug it in and guess what it works surprisingly after all that. However i Notice something was different with the boot up process so i knew something was wrong i go to the setting of the computer and the version i bought was 8gb of ram i5 model with 128gb of memory the one i receive as a replacement this time was a 4gb version i5 model with 128gb of memory and GUESS WHAT A DIFFERENT GRAPHICS CARD AS WELL. The surface pro 7 i got not only had 4gb of ram which was wrong but a different graphics card as well that comes in a surface pro 5 are you serious.... so i called up customer service again asking for a supervisor yet again..... just wanting a refund the man told me well i see here that you have a couple of exchange for this device already so i told him this story i am telling now and ask him i wonder why i have “a couple of exchanges” to which he said well instead of a refund i can get you a brand new one and told me how he had to make a couple of phone calls to do this for me so i told him this is the last exchange I’ll be getting ill be asking for a refund next like i previously wanted..if the next one comes in the renewed box which that would mean it’s used.. if it’s broken or the wrong model I’m done with trying and I’m done with the surface pro 7. not only was this the worst experience with amazon that I’ve ever had and worst costumer Service but now I’m going to hate the surface pro 7 because of this. I’ll see what i receive next as of 02/23/2020Sorry for the long review but i felt my experience should be shared for others to see."
6,5.0 stars,  Very please with the easy setup and you'd expect. Powerful i7 processor and 16GB RAM. I am able to run Photoshop and other editing software with no issues. No Lag when using multiple apps like Xbox Live and Netflix. Overall super pleased with new tablet! Still connects to the same dock!
7,5.0 stars,"  I initially bought a Surface Go(8gb) for a gift and when I had it in my hands I fell in love with the Surface. I had to get one for myself. Since I didn't find another 8gb surface go model, I went w/ the Pro 7 i5/8gb model myself. I am in love with this device. Watching netflix is great,  Illustrator and other drawing software works great w/ the surface pen. Keyboard took a few minutes to get the hang of it and I quite enjoy it, it works well. It is a bit heavy when holding it w/ one hand (this is why I loved the Surface GO version for normal tablet use) but it is quite light overall.Also tested a few games and it actually surprised me a bit tacking into account this is the i5 model. I am able to play Halo Reach just fine, (note that I had to lower the resolution down to 1080p) and it plays good. Minecraft plays really well. I didnt actually get this for gaming ( lol ) but it plays light games just great (of course it gets warm w/ Reach). StardewValley FTW! Currently this is my primary device and it performs extremely well. If you have the extra cash, do go for the i7 model mainly for the 16gb of RAM. OS consumes around 2.5-3GB of ram, so that doesnt leave much left on the 8GB model. I personally did not have an extra 500$ just to get the i7 model."
8,1.0 stars,  The product does not come with original packaging. It is a generic cardboard box
9,5.0 stars,"  My previous laptop was a godzilla, 15 inch monitor, weighs like 3 pounds or something (2014 model). I was looking for something that had the horsepower for what I needed, but also the lightness to carry it around. Although battery life isnt, the best, I DON'T MIND!This thing is a beast! Im very happy running programs like tableau, zoom, excel, powerpoint, all at the same time and with various files and this thing doesn't even flinch. The first few hours setting up and downloading all the programs it felt a big sluggish and I was starting to get worried. Once that was done, it started to fly.Yes, the rotating screen isnt as flawless as apple's iPad. That said, I bought this not to look pretty, i bought it to be my tool in battle. Being able to run all the programs that a regular PC can run is the main decision I went for Microsoft Surface.  The only downside is that Microsoft is a bit costly on the accessories front.I recommend this piece of tech to anyone who needs to travel or is on the move.  I'm a relatively big guy and i've had no major problem with the size of the keyboard. I do put it FLAT on tables because my keystrokes tend to be pretty hard and the keyboard is the most (in my opinion) fragile of the accessories.Lastly, the Pen interface is not perfect YET but oh man, as a first timer working with it, it kicks total ass and makes note taking in OneNote a complete positive trip."
10,2.0 stars,  We ordered the Surface Pro 7. Received the box which had stickers over the description saying it was a 7. Booted up the machine and it told us it was a 6 which we confirmed by the lack of a USB-C port on it. Beware.
11,1.0 stars,"  Just want to make sure no one makes the same mistake. This version of Surface ""PRO"" comes with windows ""HOME"" if your going to use with with a domain plan on an extra $100 charge to update. Amazon and Microsoft should be ashamed for putting that restriction in the product title and not burying it deep inside the product specification. Shame on you both!!"
12,1.0 stars,"  I decided to return the Surface Pro 7 due to the bad battery life.I tried to update the firmware, reset the device however unfortunetly am not able to obtain more than 3 hours of normal usage (web browser, youtube, light office tools, pdf reading). I did a test (max. brightness and best performance mode in Windows) and played from youtube a video. The result is that in 1 hour the battery level reached 52%.Before purchasing the product, I read and checked on youtube allot of reviews, none of them declared such bad performance (hardware or software)."
13,1.0 stars,"  my surface pro 7 just arrived, and I'm disappointed in the fact that the illustration shows a keyboard, but it's not included with my order. I now see in tiny print that the keyboard / cover is not included, but it's certainly not obvious. I think this is misleading, and any illustration should always match the product advertised. If that is asking too much, then you can certainly make the disclaimer larger, and easy to see, and read. I will not refer this seller for this reason, unless I can somehow get the keyboard / cover as I thought I had purchased in the first place."
14,4.0 stars,"  When deciding to buy the surface pro 7 to replace the pro 4 I thought when reaching for a laptop which of the two did I reach for the most the surface beat the 15"" full laptop every time. Its a fully functional windows laptop with the weight of a tablet without the limitations. I watch videos do 3d modeling coding browse the web send & receive emails. Battery life varies based on use I found video streaming drains it quickly on all laptops I've used. I went from a core I5 to an core I7 which maybe causing more heat than before. When shopping check your requirements extreme needs require an extreme system"
15,1.0 stars,"  This product sucks. I bough it last week and now, it is freez and not even the Microsoft tips to re-start the system works. I am really mad. It is expensive and it does not work properly."
16,4.0 stars,"  I like this tablet, nice to have for my Chem class so I can work problems right on the notes and study materials without printing them out. Plenty fast for the uses I have it for and the screen is beautiful.  Also really love the kickstand, it folds all the way back into ""studio mode"" and works great for taking notes. Only reason it's not 5 star is because I was sent a surface pro 6 when I ordered a surface pro 7. Didnt notice til the day after I got it and Microsoft emailed me saying ""welcome to the surface pro 6"", then I noticed it had the old usb port and confirmed it was the old model by looking in the software. Attached a picture showing the tablet saying it's a pro 6 and the box saying it's a pro 7. Beware of this. That said, I did get a prompt exchange but it cost me a few hours setting up a tablet and then deleting everything from it to return it, and then had to wait for a new one. Others on here have reported the same thing happening, really suspicious."
17,1.0 stars,  The store make a mistake and send me instead of a i7 16ram and 521gbY receive a i3 4ram an 128gbI travel to my country and I hire a technician to install all the software I need and he told me that the machine doesn't work with the programs I need.So now I have to send it back and lost the money I pay for the installation an the tampered glass installed and at least 2 weeks of work for not having the computer.Very upset for the experience and economicall lost.
18,1.0 stars,"  I've had this for less than 2 weeks and it won't charge at all. I tried going to the technical support but the website says it's not available, I went to the manufacturers website and their advice is useless, do they really think I wouldn't have tried plugging it in to a different outlet? Making sure everything is connected securely?I'm not happy. My last computer lasted for 11 years, and technically it's still going strong it's just too out of date for what I want to do with it, and this brand new one lasts for 2 weeks? I take really good care of my devices, I still have my original iPod, I kept my Nook until it stopped being supported, I've never had problems with tech before. I'm just really frustrated. I was so excited to finally get a new computer, I spent a lot of time picking this one out and deciding what specs I wanted it to have, and it goes kaput almost immediately."
19,5.0 stars,"  The portability and comfort of the tablet with the functionality of a full-fledged laptop. I bought a Surface 3 several years ago and now... I can't go back. I love these things too much. It comes with me everywhere. If you're wondering why buy a Surface which is twice the price of a laptop, here's why:1. If you read a lot of pdfs or e-books there is no comparison.  Using the pen on pdfs, the ability to jot down notes in word or pictorial form, the ability to create links to other information that can later be clicked on: Unmatched anywhere else  Turn it sideways and it's a full sheet of paper for writing and notetaking  Turn it sideways to read Comic Books! OMG!  I'll be honest, I'm a gamer and this is my gaming buddy. I pull up ESO maps and One Note allows me to mark up the maps I find online to check off what I've accomplished, rearranged, plan, it's incredible2. Versatility  I watch a lot of movies and tv on my advice. It's comfortable, easy to hold, just the right size screen, phenomenal graphics and good sound  As previously stated, I read on my device  I am a student. I Word Process. A LOT  I am an Excel nut. I spreadsheet like a crazy person. I attach a mouse and organize my life.  I spend a ton of time using video conferencing on this thing3. Physical Perfection (OK so it is not as light as your tablet but for what it can do, totally worth the extra weight which isn't that much)  Just the right size screen which is totally touch and pen friendly  Good battery life and easy and fast to charge. Not so happy about the way the charger connects with the longer part of the charger pointing down which makes it super easy to accidentally dislodge the magnet (CON 1)In my opinion, this is the perfect electronic for my lifestyleSo, what's wrong with it?Only one USB port and no place to insert extra storage or portable storage without using your only USB portNo MICRO SD Card slotThe Charger connection is A. Not universal and B. Stupidly located. You'd think Microsoft would have figured out by now that if you use a laptop ON your lap it'll get disconnected due to poor locationBUY THE KEYBOARD! If you want a tablet, buy a tablet, If you want a computer you need a keyboard why doesn't it just come with one?Bottom line is this. If you need something versatile and not specialized, this is your computer. It's worth the money. If you're looking for something to run a specialized program or a gaming computer, this is probably not your computer. It's not the most powerful device on the market but it is by FAR the most versatile. I could not recommend a better device for students. Buy a protective case, throw it in your backpack, purse, tote, car, suitcase, whatever let it become a part of you, you won't regret it. It is my travel buddy carrying my movies, books and work with me wherever I need to go."
20,4.0 stars,"  I love this thing! I'm primarily using it as a writing tablet and e-reader for part-time grad school, and I'd like to start using it for work (engineer). It's improved my workflow a ton. The Surface Pen is great and the magnet makes for a very secure attachment. I considered the Surface Pro X, because it has an option for stowing the slim pen in its keyboard but opted for the regular surface pen after trying them out in a retail store.I've deducted one star because:The large bezel. Doesn't bother me much at all, but it really doesn't stack up to competitor designs in 2019/2020. Still looks very sleek overall.Windows 10 works surprisingly well in tablet mode, but Microsoft is really missing an opportunity by not having a good built-in or Office e-reader (epub, pdf, mobi support) with pen support for document/ebook markup. Edge doesn't cut it feature-wise. Luckily there's a popular app in the Microsoft Store called Drawboard PDF that works really well. The lack of Microsoft application support for critical Surface features is another reason for deducting a star! OneNote and other apps were great on here. I'd love to try an MS designed e-reader with pen support."
21,5.0 stars,"  I have purchased at least a dozen Surface tablets and additionaly surface laptops.  The surface line is a Microsoft product that has reached maturity and is a go to for my company.  The weight, the durability (they are not always nice to them), the accessories available in cases, etc. all bring us back again and again.  This is a true tablet PC in the very best form out there and I am responsible for hundreds of machines in our group.  I cannot recommend the surface highly enough.  And no, I do not work for MS, or know anyone there or receive any compensation."
22,1.0 stars,"  The first one failed after 11 hours use. Failed to enter bios. Would not go past the surface logo on the screen. Amazon was great at helping troubleshoot but the machine did not make it.This was replaced and the second machine lasted 48 hours. While sitting at desk the screen froze and went plaid. Not good plaid. The plays that says the video on the board just went plaid.This was a machine I needed to work and see patients. I had to make a flying run too the closest City (45-60 min) to Best Buy at 8:20PM to get there before 9:30PM closing. I had to buy the same machine with 256 gig, as that is all they had. Really put me in a bind. This new machine has lasted nearly a week and no problems. I don't know what happened to the first 2 machines. I had a surface 4 pro for over 4 years. I know then well as I do the IT for my machine."
23,1.0 stars,"  Hello, I’m writing this review to make people aware of the multiple issues I’ve had with my surface. Ever since I’ve got it I’ve had problems with it and this issues have gotten worse in the last month.1. It started with the internet connection. All of the sudden it would not connect and would only go back online after I would reset my router for some odd reason.2. The battery has been really bad, I’ve had to plug it after 4-5 hrs of use.3. I’ve had multiple blue error screens appear randomly4. The software updates are said to be completed and asks to restart the surface but even after I restarted it (multiple times) it still shows that the update is not completed. This issue does not let me download other programs or apps.5. I’ve called Microsoft way more times over the past month. After at least 5 calls in which they tried resetting to factory settings, downloading the updates, etc... They sent me a replacement that was even worse...so slow to get to any website, it would take 1-2 minutes to open google. I’ve sent the replacement back and they are supposed to send me a new one but honestly I would rather get my money back and buy a different one. Too bad the return window has closed on me already :’(The worse part is that I bought one for me and one for my husband and his has began showing performance issues as well."
24,1.0 stars,"  I found what looked to be a decent deal for an Amazon Warehouse ""Used-Acceptable"" Surface Pro 7.According to Amazon Warehouse descriptions, ""Used-Acceptable"" is described as:""Condition: Used - Acceptable - Display has cosmetic imperfections but is usable. Cosmetic imperfection(s) bigger than 1"" on top, front or sides of item. Small cosmetic imperfection on bottom or back of item. Missing bonus material. Missing manual. Accessories may have cosmetic damage. Item will come in original packaging. Packaging will be damaged.""I'm more than fine with cosmetic imperfections. Scratches, dings and signs of a unit that has been used as intended don't phase me at all.Upon opening the box, I most definitely was NOT fine....I'm not fine with a unit that has clearly been dropped with the entire lower, left corner bent/crushed and the ""cosmetic"" damage to the lower left screen is actually the display inside (the cover/coating is fine) has been bent/pinched.It won't even fit in a form fitting Otterbox case the bend is pronounced enough.I contacted Microsoft and they will of course be happy to replace it......for $450+tax (~500.00 USD).Accessories were perfect, and ironically, the packaging was perfect too.Very disappointed with Amazon Warehouse on this one."
25,3.0 stars,"  I've had this computer for a while now. At first everything was golden, but now not so much.Pros:This computer is the perfect size for someone on the go. Its compact, but still has a decently sized screen for getting work done. In general, the computer is fast, the face recognition login is great when it works.Cons:There are many issues with the software or hardware, but I don't know which since I'm not a computer expert. The volume controls constantly freeze, so the volume is unable to be adjusted by any means until the computer gets restarted. There is an issue where the curser constantly freezes, but I can not tell if its the computer freezing or the mouse controls. As mentioned above, the face recognition login is fast, when it works. There have been many occasions where the face login stopped working randomly until the computer is restarted.I don't know where these issues are coming from, but they can make this computer a pain in the butt to use. Additionally, to maximize use of the computer, I highly recommend the keyboard cover, a pen, and a mouse."
26,1.0 stars,"  Update: THIS IS A SURFACE PRO 5!!!!When I wrote the review below, I did not know WHY it had a minidisplay port. It ALSO has a dual core NOT a quad core like the  surface pro 7. This is not an honest mistake. I paid for ""the latest model"".Original issue here:I am 65, have been disabled for 8 years, and am learning a new career out of necessity. The career requires a tablet, so after exhaustive research, I invested in a loaded Microsoft Surface Pro 7. This is a huge deal for me. As I am waiting on the keyboard and other accessories, I am learning how to use it - my first tablet. The 5-in-1 hub adapter I purchased did not fit. How could this be? I bought one for Type C port, newly available on the new version of this tablet. The Amazon ad said newest version. Ends up the tablet has what I believe is a mini-display port in place of a Type C, so I can't use it. I have to return the tablet. I NEED THIS FOR WORK. I WASTED MONEY ON THE HUB ADAPTER. I WASTED TIME LOADING THIS COMPUTER THAT I NEEDED TO USE IN TRAINING. Very unhappy.If someone compensates me and makes this right I will remove this comment. But I am leaving it now because I just got a response from Amazon""Hi Amazon Customer,We sent your question about Microsoft Surface Pro 7 –... to the Amazon community and unfortunately none of them have yet responded.Questions remain unanswered when we do not have enough customers to ask or when the question is particularly difficult to answer. At this point your question is unlikely to receive an answer, but it will remain posted on Amazon and we will notify you if anyone responds.Thank you for shopping on Amazon!""hahahahaha good one, guys!"
27,4.0 stars,"  Great for travelers who need a functional computer that can also serve as a tablet. I got th Surface Pro 7 because I travel for work and will also be starting grad school so I may need to study on the plane or after work in the hotels. I wanted the full functionality of a computer that would allow me to use MS Office programs as well as the functionality of a touch screen, tablet and inking feature to take notes for class. I am just getting accustomed to the inking feature but I can see that it will be a great asset to me during my program and I enjoy the overall portability of the Microsoft Surface Pro 7.  The screen size is just right for me as I don’t like large computers. I have also purchased a wireless keyboard and mouse for when at home to make it even easier to use when typing papers or working on projects. I also purchased a cute flowered skin with white. sage, pink and gray to protect the metal from any nicks or scratches.  I also purchased the silver pen and got a sage green skin to protect it. I like that the pen magnetically attaches to the side of the Surface Pro 7 and that the pen can erase using the eraser on the pen. The only reason I gave it four rather than five stars is that I am finding that not all apps are offered in the Surface Pro that I currently have. The selection seems quite limited and you can’t get apps from iTunes or Google Play as neither service is compatible with Windows. I am most disappointed that Scribd is not offered as I was hoping to be able to read books while in flight. I have read that there is VM Ware apps that may work. I am not very technical so I don’t know much about it. I appreciate any suggestions from Microsoft or techies on how I can upload Scribd on my Surface Pro 7. Thank you!"
28,5.0 stars,"  I really like this Surface Pro 7. It is exactly as advertised with one exception. The battery life is nowhere near what is advertised. On battery saving mode, using only Onenote for taking class notes, it lasts about 4 hours. Fortunately it charges up very quickly though. I can't see any way that I would get a full days use out of a full battery charge in any circumstance. In my case that is not very important because I am always around an outlet but if you need a tablet that will last all day away from a power source you will have a problem. The camera is good enough, not as good as the Apple camera, but I don't really use it as a camera anyway. I use mostly the 365 programs and find that it integrates these programs seamlessly. Onenote comes with the tablet and has been an amazing app for my vet school classes.  It saves my many hours of study time. My only issues are with the instability of Onenote. It closes itself down every few minutes and is very frustrating. I'm sure there is a fix for this but I'm also sure that I won't get it from Microsorft as they have a technical support team that is on par with the customer service team at the cable company. I've contacted them 3 times now and my issue is never addressed. I was actually told to contact Amazon since they sold it to me. It seems like after spending a thousand dollars on Microsoft products they would at least provide a bit of tech support.  I'll just have to scour the web for a fix to this I guess. Overall I would recommend this tablet to every student. It seems to be a fantastic and fast machine."
29,1.0 stars,"  I bought this device to have experience with windows. I have used Android tablets and iPad but this device has included holder so I decided it is very good for table and watching videos. It was mistake. iPad would be much better. Seriously. It looks like they ignore or other devices. Microsoft lives in their own word. Do you think that start video on youtube is easy? You wrong. Sometimes it turn off full screen mode, sometimes video is stoped, sometimes touch is ignored. And it is just simple touch. Windows, in any mode, is not ready to work with touchscreen. And one more thing. I have found a window with screen saver settings. It is taken from Win95, I suppose. Perfect!"
30,4.0 stars,"  The Microsoft Surface line is still the best tablet for folks who need to use full desktop packages on the go. Pricing is similar to the iPad Pro series (once you get the keyboards and stylus for each), but you are getting a full desktop experience here. So less compromises on the applications you may need to run. Latest i7 plus a decently fast SSD makes this a good portable workhorse. Battery life is not ideal, and you will hear the machine spin up when you're running bigger apps, but the portability and light weight is generally worth it. Light gaming is possible with the i7 Iris graphics, and you can do work with both Photoshop and Lightroom without spending too much more time than on your main machine. If your need for a mobile computer is ""Work first"" rather than ""Create first"", then this will be your best bet."
31,5.0 stars,  Very portable fast and handy. The touch screen works ok but when using software designed for a full size screen with mouse and keyboard it can be awkward. Touching with a finger is not as accurate as a mouse and enlarging the image creates a tunnel vision situation when the whole webpage isn't visible. So bottom line a great tablet but not a replacement for a full size PC. Buying the keyboard helps a lot. With it typing is possible without giving up half the screen for a virtual keypad and there's a mouse touch pad eliminating the need to the touch screen when accuracy is needed. The connection of the charging cable and keyboard is a clever magnetic grab the eliminates the awkward insertion effort like for micro USB or headphones.
32,1.0 stars,  This was the first Microsoft hardware device I ever bought. It lasted just seven weeks before it crapped out. I returned it to Microsoft and they had the balls to replace it with a refurbished item. I am beyond upset. I cannot recommenced this product and will never buy any Microsoft hardware device again.
33,5.0 stars,"  Surface pro 7 is the best 2 in 1 Windows device according to critics and you get to feel that from the first glance. The packaging & shipping is well done. The device shipped within the expected time frame.As for the device itself, I found the screen size  of 12.3 inches to be a little bit on the bigger side for a tablet mode but is perfect for laptop use. the screen colors are vibrant and supports touch. Windows Hello lets you sign into your account via face recognition, I find it to be more convenient than writing the password to login. I got the I5 8GB version and the windows 10 experience is very smooth for browsing the web, using Microsoft office and other productivity work. I believe for the average person there is no need to buy a higher specs, I5 can get the job done.Surface pro 7 experience is not complete without the Type cover keyboard and Surface pen. Both are a must if you want get the best out of the device and they are worth their price tags.I want to highlight that though this device is a 2-In-1, it is a significantly better laptop than a tablet. If you are looking for a better tablet experience you might want to checkout iPad devices."
34,5.0 stars,"  My Surface Pro 5 upped and died on me (dead battery cell which caused a complete system failure). Really unhappy that a two year old supposedly solid product crapped out on me, but up until then it had been a great machine.Bought the SP7 to replace it and I'm delighted. It's about 4 time as fast."
35,4.0 stars,"  I purchased this new surface after years of great service from my Surface pro 3.  It’s snappy, and everything I expect from a lightweight computer and more.  Two critiques:  the black finish scratches easily.  I added a skin to protect it.  Second it doesn’t play well with older Surface docking stations or Docks.  If you put the computer in sleep mode and the plug it into a dock , the video on a large monitor gives you trouble."
36,1.0 stars,"  My big problem with Microsoft Surface computer is that although the computer is very good, the batteries are of very bad quality. The tend to overheat and end up destroying the computer Itself. It has happened on tow Microsoft Surface recently purchased... in both cases the battery failed and destroyed both computers. It has never happened to me in 30 years. It is terrible to have this battery problem on computers from Microsoft that are supposedly high end"
37,1.0 stars,"  Was sent wrong product... I received surface pro 6 instead of surface pro 7... From others' comments, Im not the only one that this happened to... As if that wasn't enough the surface pro 6 didn't even work half the time... Had a hard drive issue preventing boot... So even if I hadn't noticed the bait and switch I would have been left with a faulty device"
38,4.0 stars,  Perfect light and powerful only thing missing is thunderbolt
39,1.0 stars,"  I was very excited to get this as i was planning to use it for my small business. I recieved the device in early June and everything seemed fine for the first 4 weeks. Then I started noticing the fan was getting loud while it was on but I thought maybe it would go away. It just got louder and stayed longer. I was past the 30 day Amazon return window so I went through Microsoft directly. The told me to send it back to them and they would send me a new device. Instead they sent me a refurbished device. I was unhappy with this since my brand new device was less than 2 mo the old and i don't know anyone that would pay over $1000 for a refurbished drvice. After speaking to several people, getting transferred to wrong departments and getting hung up on several times I was finally told that there is nothing they can do. I am an extremely disappointed customer and will never purchase a device from Microsoft in the future."
40,1.0 stars,  Horrible junk!!!!Quit working out of nowhere at six weeks out of the box. Amazon had nothing in stock and said could be up to two months or return and go buy elsewhere. Ok well that cost me an additional $400 for the same item in order to get back up and running  because microsoft and amazon sold a junk product withba comletitor price differential to get a new one same day.Awful product reliability and awful customer service. Lost twice and my wallet lost bigtime.Amazon wont stand behind their sold product and microsoft makes junk devices.
41,5.0 stars,"  Simply one of the best computers I've used for graphic design work, office work and school work. This is my second surface and I'm loving the upgrade. My last one I had since they first came out. I think it was about 12 years old. I handed it down to my daughter cuz it's still great. I'm sure the new one is going to last me even longer."
42,1.0 stars,  Your browser does not support HTML5 video.   I was initially pleased with my device. Then it needed an update that caused it not to power back on. They ended up sending me a replacement that I received today & it doesn't power on either. Over $1900 for a device that doesn't work. My frustration is through the roof! I will never spend this kind of money on a Microsoft device again. My HP touchscreen works better. So disappointed. Not sure how this will be resolved but stay tuned folks. I will follow up. Its Oct 22nd 2020. I still do not have a working device. I feel sick! 🤮
43,5.0 stars,"  Most powerful laptop I've ever owned and also the lightest and most expensive.  By the time you've added the docking station, headphones, HDMI converter cables, pen, and keyboard, you're probably spending close to $2000.  But - this tiny slim machine is so fast, so powerful.  It has become my sole computer for work and personal.  And it's a joy to travel with since everything tucks away neatly and the battery lasts across the Atlantic and back."
44,1.0 stars,"  Initially things seemed fine.  One week after I could no longer return the product... blue screen of death and I’m waiting to hear from the company.  Unless they stand behind their product, I recommend not doing business with them.  I will update my review if they step up to the plate and replace or refund.  Nothing else is acceptable."
45,1.0 stars,"  Purchased the Surface Pro 7 on 9/30/2020.  On 10/10/2020 it stopped working.  It would not turn on.  I called Amazon customer service and spoke to Brian.  He patiently attempted to get my tablet to work but was unsuccessful.  He got in touch with the Microsoft service representatives to troubleshoot my issue.  When I provided the product’s serial number, they told me that the product I purchased was a Surface Pro 5 and not a Surface Pro 7.Brian assisted me in getting a refund for the Surface Pro “7”.  I found out later that I purchased the item through a third party vendor.  If not for the product breaking down, I would have been stuck with a Surface Pro 5."
46,1.0 stars,  I must admit I am thoroughly disappointed in the performance of this device. Does not not meet expectations even though it was highly recommended.  I do moderate video editing and wanted something portable so I can work when away from home.  I guess my research before purchasing wasn't thorough enough.I have to constantly wait on the device to process rendering.  Even just merely opening explorer folders causes the device to freeze.  I am not where close to the maximum storage limit so that can't be the reason.  With 8fb Ram I expect better frankly.Now after spending over $1200 on this I find myself in the market for another device.
47,5.0 stars,"  If you have been using your phone apps it may take awhile to become totally comfortable with Microsoft but you can sync your cell phone to this device! That makes some things easier to use. I strongly recommend getting Microsoft 365, it is very useful if you need Word, Exel, Calendar, emails, etc. all in one place. Worth the price in my opinion."
48,5.0 stars,  This is my first purchase of a laptop and any surface product. I did my research on the device before purchasing because I'm doing remote learning and an art major so I already knew what I wanted in a laptop and the pro 7 delivered! I bought this laptop as new so I don't know the case for the rest of these reviews but mine came in the box sealed with plastic NEW WITH EVERYTHING WORKING. Screen works perfect as a laptop/tablet and connects well with my metro smart hotspot. The only downside is that I paid so much hoping for the sim card or esim option to be there but it wasn't and although the battery still needs improvement I find that if you allow the laptop to rest every hour the battery drains less. I work so I don't have to use it every second but something to keep in mind.
49,1.0 stars,"  After just one month of use, I got the UEFI booting issue which many others also reported online including on Microsoft's official tech support forum. I have tried all options suggested by Microsoft supports and none worked.  On these forums, many customers were just as unlucky as me. We have tried all combinations of holding/releasing various buttons for various time intervals, almost like just trying random combinations of a safe. The recovery usb didn't work either. The most favored answer on Microsoft's forum is actually just getting a replacement, which I can't due to obviously privacy issues. The local Microsoft store has been closed since the outbreak of coivd19. The bright side is it went broken so fast, fast enough before I saved much important work on it. Equivalently I paid $14K for a brick. Guess I am going to buy any Microsoft devices again?"
50,4.0 stars,  Battery life on this unit is a joke.  Must bring the charger everywhere.So far I like the computer overall.
51,5.0 stars,"  I waited a couple of years to move to a Surface.  Wasn't sure if it was more a tablet than a computer or computer than a tablet.  Got a couple of bucks and dove in.  So far, it is just what I wanted, a computer that works like a tablet.  The speeds are great. The screen fantastic. It takes my Office 365 with ease. The keyboard works great when I am not using the docking port. And the ease of the docking port allows me to use a 32"" screen with my Surface. I use online for most documents so the 128 SSD is plenty for what I need to store at home. Plus it coupled perfectly with my WD backup system.  I haven't  been disappointed yet and I don't expect to be.  Recommend this to anyone.  Unless you have to have high levels of storage or demand faster processing time this Surface at this price should meet all your needs."
52,1.0 stars,"  Bait-and-Switch scam. It is advertised as a Surface Pro 7, but you will receive a Pro 6. The first time I assumed was an honest mistake, returned, and re-order it. Second time. Same trick. I contacted the vendor, and they tried to convince me to keep it for a price difference.  This is an illegal practice to advertise goods which are an apparent bargain, with the intention of substituting inferior or more expensive goods.Both models look very similar and easily mistaken if you do not pay attention. The Surface Pro 7 has a USB-C oval port on the upper-right side. The Pro 6 has a mini-Display square port."
53,1.0 stars,"  MS Surface should not have this problem. Had happily used Surface for 3 years and finally decided to upgrade from Pro 4 to Pro 7. Excited when the product arrived and, like other Pro lovers, carefully put on the screen protector before switching it on. Immediately noticed the strange, evenly distributed horizontal lines at the bottom, about 3/5 of the entire screen. Restarted the machine after setting up was completed, the situation got worse (see picture). Seller- please explain and provide a solution."
54,3.0 stars,"  The device failed to charge just after my second attempt to fully charge it, thought it was the unit that is broken lucky enough it was only the charger. Tho having to shell out another 45 dollars to buy a new charger for a 6 days old device in a downer, hope amazon can make up for the additional cash outlay cos its not worth it. Batterry life is also bad really bad I think, I usually use  ms word and do some readings Im not even connected to wifi and the device is on battery saver yet I only get 3 to 5 hours of battery way far from what is claimed by microsoft. The rest its all good great camera, speakers, touchscreen."
55,5.0 stars,  I went through all of the reviews of all of the different products.  I wanted something that my wife (an artist) could use to draw and sketch -- that had good battery life that could also be used as a general purpose laptop.  I purchased an aftermarket pen -- and the microsoft keyboard.  She loves it.  The battery power appears as advertised and it works like any other windows 10 laptop.  The pen interface is exceptional.
56,2.0 stars,"  Not happy with the Surface Pro 7. I purchased a new Surface Pro 7 and every time it was powered up, it came up with the blue screen of death, it would collect data, then reboot normally. I returned it, and got another new Surface Pro 7; this new unit just decide to shut off randomly. Tech support said it was a known issue, and that I should make sure all the updates have been installed. I installed all the updates (about 20), and it still shuts off randomly. Looks like this one is going back, no more Surface Pro 7's."
57,4.0 stars,  There is a pixel defect in the upper left quadrant of my brand new Surface Pro 7. I like the Surface Pro and will purchase another one but they need better quality control.  Deal for Less provided a full refund in a timely manner.
58,1.0 stars,"  I purchased it end of Sep.  Didn't read it clearly that keyboard was not included (don't know why).  Ordered 1, was a mismatch.  Returned it then ordered another one.  It was a good match.  However, had hard time to connect it to Pro 7.  Thought the keyboard had a problem.  So I returned keyboard.  This time I ordered from the local Best Buy store.  Hoping that if there is any issue, Best Buy can help me.  I spent 2 hours in Best Buy store and it only worked 5 seconds.  That's it!  There is no customer service from Microsoft.  Amazon tech support is nice but they are not specialize on the products.  Sadly I have to return it.  I'll buy it from Best Buy because I can get help from the local store if there is any issue... Loved the touch screen though."
59,2.0 stars,"  I bought it for academic studies, software engineering. Just an excellent computer very powerful and runs everything.I am personally also satisfied with the battery life that provides me with no less than 7-6 hours****After two months of using the original charging socket computer stopped working, I found out that the warranty on the computer had already started, by March the warranty was valid, and I purchased the product in July,In addition to that the battery is very disappointing, the computer heats up a lot, many times the computer freezes and I have to turn it off and on to work with it again,Tablet mode not so convenient,"
60,5.0 stars,"  This is a nice tablet/lap top hybrid.  But, it is identical to my Pro 3 except for the i7 chip in the Pro 7.  But, that is not enough for me to justify spending the money.  Except for the i7 chips, it looks and acts like my Pro 3 so I returned it.  If you are looking for a tablet/laptop hybrid and don’t have a Pro, you will like this product."
61,5.0 stars,  Works great and no issues so far. I was surprised by the facial recognition feature. It’s pretty amazing to not type my password every time. The device is quick and easy to use. This isn’t so great for listening to music without headphones as the speakers are not very clear but I don’t need good speakers. The stand in the back feels a little flimsy but I have a case that covers it and has it’s own propping abilities so again doesn’t matter. The battery life compared to my Mac is unimpressive. It probably lasts 3-5 hours in use. It came new and turned right on.
62,3.0 stars,"  Touch screen is nice, pen input is great. You can't game almost anything in it, even though it is an i5. Minecraft is choppy.Battery... Oh boy! Save your bucks for other thing. Battery time is really lame, worse laptop battery I've ever had."
63,5.0 stars,  This is an amazing product. It's so fast and reliable. It really blows away other tablet computers and ultralight laptops.
64,2.0 stars,"  I've had my surface for about 8 months.  In that time it's been nothing but issue after issue.  It's constantly updating and every time it updates things get a little worse.  I can't keep a desktop picture, the screen just goes to black in a few days.  It will restart and suddenly go through the initial setup process all over again.  Once it even failed so hard I had to reinstall windows to fix it.  There are connectivity issues when other computers in the office are working fine.  All in all, I don't recommend buying a surface.  They seem to be problematic."
65,4.0 stars,"  This was a used tablet and looks NEW although there is a VERY small scratch in the glass, but it really isn't noticable.I bought a screen protector for it right away and will not use it until i put the protector on so as to not scratch it any more."
66,5.0 stars,  The processor is significantly faster than previous versions and the newer Ipad Pro.  I love the connectivity across my devices including using my phone app to sync my phone while I work without having to use two devices.
67,1.0 stars,  The seller sent a Surface Pro 4 in a Surface Pro 7 box.It broke down within 3 months of use because it was a 6 year old machine.  I only found out when the tech pro I called discovered it was not an actual Surface Pro 7...
68,5.0 stars,  I like everything about this tablet/laptop.  I only wish that Microsoft would design a cover for it that fits like a glove!
69,5.0 stars,  Bought it for my husband’s birthday gift. He is surprised and happy that I bought this for him cuz he wants to buy it for a while. I am glad he likes this birthday gift. He said it’s a perfect gift and the surface works as he expected. The camera quality is better than the iPad.
70,1.0 stars,"  tuve 2 con problemas, muy mala experiencia, la primera me duro una semana y despues se apago y nunca mas se prendio, la segunda el primer dia ya se apago y nunca se prendio, tambien tenga cuidado los que no viven en EEUU, yo vivo en Paraguay y devolvi las 2 tablet que no me funcionaron y  Amazon me devolvio el dinero de una nomas, me cobro 2, y me dijeron que ellos no se hacen responsables de productos que salen fuera de su pais, como cliente Prime que soy para mi no era la respuesta, sigo peleando para que me devuelvan el dinero"
71,3.0 stars,  DID NOT COME WITH THE KEYBOARD. I was under the impression that it included the keyboard for this used price. Should of went elsewhere.  Ive tested battery life in the mean time and it was below a typical refurb.
72,1.0 stars,"  I got this computer as a replacement for my touchscreen foldable samsung chrome book, let me say the first couple months were great with this computer but then I accidentally knocked the back of it with my phone, and it messed up like half of the screen. I payed over 700 dollars for this computer and a little knock to the back of it ruins the screen. The whole bottom is all pixelated and glitches with little dots all around the screen. I would not recommend it. I also don’t want to spend $450 to send it back and get it repaired only for it to potentially happen again. Will not buy again."
73,1.0 stars,  I paid so much money and not worth at all. I came from a 6 years old Mac and it it still way better computer. The only reason I bought it is because of the weight because it Is the lightest in the market but I totally regret paying so much. All the systems failure and trying to get it fix? Good luck waiting on the phone. Theirs stores are un-existing. Nothing like apple 1 and 1000 times better product
74,1.0 stars,"  The keyboard is not included and it has to be purchased separately, but when you look at the pictures it looks like it is included. This is really upsetting. You should let your customers clearly know what they’re buying."
75,1.0 stars,"  No recomiendo a nadie la microsoft surface pro 7. Si buscan en internet encontrarán que muchos usuarios reportan este mismo problema que ni microsoft ni en foros ni en servicio técnico sabe solucionar. Es un fracaso que un producto insignia como este para una compañía tan grande tengo este tipo de defectos. Ahora la voy a devolver esperando que hagan efectiva la garantía. Nota: no pude usar ni un solo día esta computadora e intenté de todo: actualizaciones, restauraciones entre otras cosas y nada."
76,5.0 stars,  Sold my ipad pro and bought this surface. So happy I purchased the surface. It's the best of both worlds.
77,3.0 stars,  I’ve had it a few mo this now and am still not the happiest with it. It had major problems with screen glitches. Had to delete and reload drives a couple of times.  Definitely not as good as I had hoped.
78,5.0 stars,  Pictured with keyboard and stylus.Keyboard and stylus not included.Incredibly deceptive.
79,3.0 stars,"  Actually enjoyed this product until the device completely stopped working after 2 weeks of use. Lost photoshop files I hadn't yet backed up, so you can imagine I was rightly upset. Was just getting to know the product and liking it, but I do not know if I will ever try purchasing with this seller again."
80,3.0 stars,  Did satisfy mid to heavy usage on day to day basis. Poor battery life.
81,4.0 stars,  Not the sellers fault. I ordered one of these and the one that I got had a hardware issue with its wifi component. I returned it and got reimbursed for the one I purchased. It might have been a fluke accident. No wifi is reason for the 4 star. The surface itself is amazing.
82,3.0 stars,  Description claims I would be receiving a Surface Pro 7 but what I got was a Surface Pro 6.Machine runs well enough but I needed the Iris Plus graphics that is in the current generation.
83,5.0 stars,"  Extremely fast! (I5 , 8gb ram).This is my third surface pro.I'm using with my old (and still perfect) surface keyboard (Pro 4 version).The battery charges much faster than previous versions."
84,5.0 stars,"  Got this a month or so ago and it's been great! Touch screen is nice. Got a keyboard and mouse to add on. And the pen. It's been a great help with documenting. I thought it came with Office access. I guess it does, I just didn't realize you had to pay to activate it."
85,5.0 stars,"  The Surface Pro is very lightweight and I am looking forward to taking it on trips.  Haven't used it much yet, but it was very easy to set up.  I also got the typing cover and it's great."
86,5.0 stars,  Good item. I owned a Surface pro and loved it. Had issues with activating the license but my work IT person was able to get me a new corporate license.

88,1.0 stars,"  Loved the product when I received it....but less than 3 weeks , it won't even power up. Reached out to the seller today. Hope they positively respond ASAP."
89,5.0 stars,  My wife loves it! She has been trying various things and so far has been very happy. She hasnt really messed with camera yet so i can't comment on that just yet. It came in quickly. It was fairly easy to set up even though she was only slightly familiar with Windows 10. Ithink her favorites are the art apps that are available.
90,4.0 stars,  UPDATE:Replacement surface is great. After a brief scare where it wasn't charging the Surface is an awesome tool. The mix of functionality makes it great to go from the office to the couch.Original:Currently busted out of the box. Wont turn on unless its plugged in and when it does I see a thermometer screen. Shouldn't happen on day/when it's cold to the touch. Will update when the replacement gets here.

101,1.0 stars,  First unit was lost in shipment. Took another 30 days to get a new shipment. Now I cannot get the OS to activate. Have tried all methods for activation. Cannot get anyone at MS to stay on the phone (have been hung up on 3 times). My online MS account keeps logging me out before I can create an online help request. Complete waste of money for me.
102,5.0 stars,"  Doesn’t have the longest battery life but that may be because I use heavier duty programs all at once. Had some issues with WiFi connectivity but it fixed itself. Touchscreen is useful for digital graphics and editing. Also very easy to learn, this is my first non apple computer."

198,3.0 stars,"  I expected a lot from this Microsoft Surface Pro 7.  Technology has come so far...I've had an Apple iPad for years...it's not new (so old, in fact, that I can't remember what version or what size it is).  I certainly expected this brand-new tech to beat that old iPad.This has a lovely picture, but it has a lot of dead-space around the edge.  I have no idea why we should have so much dead space around the edge of a screen.  I get it that some is normal, but this is almost an inch all around.The ability to flip from landscape to portrait views is painfully slow.The touch screen is very slow, and sometimes doesn't notice my touch at all.I have had repeated incidents of the tablet not noticing that I need a keyboard.  Trying everything, I finally had to go to my laptop to complete my task.It does have nice video, sound, and can handle my typical multiple-tasks and multiple-tabs open at once.I have been using this mainly for school, and for that it's ""okay"".  The inability to depend on the keyboard or touch screen is an issue.  Right now it's pretty much an e-reader and back up to my laptop.I hope I got a lemon, and that others do not have to deal with these issues.  This is a lot of money to pay for something that doesn't work properly."
199,1.0 stars,"  Dislike: everything!  I only use this because it’s my work laptop that my company bought.  I wish it was a Mac.  Mac’s are so much faster and efficient!  I have lots of problems with the Surface Pro, internal and external."
200,2.0 stars,"  1/ Surface pro 7 so much hotter than Surface pro 6, hot as hell when normal using. When charge i think this Surface pro 7 can burn...2/ I have 2 bright pixel on screen, so bad Hardware3/ Battery very bad, i think just like 70% battery life surface pro 6Never buy Surface one more time. Wasted my money !"
201,5.0 stars,"  There are several technical reviews available if you're interested in more specific details related to this model.From a non technical perspective, the Microsoft Surface Pro 7 is basically a really well designed laptop without the keyboard.I love the fact that it turns on and off fairly quickly. After the device is put to sleep, it turns back on almost instantly when you push the power button to wake it up from sleep.Operation of apps and programs are fast and smooth. It is Windows 10, and has all of the wonderful features that Windows 10 provides.There are only a few minor cons that I have noticed so far.Depending on the program you are using, you may benefit from having a bluetooth mouse available. I have not figured out a work around yet for when I need to drag and drop, or right click, without having a physical mouse type device to assist.The on screen keyboard is actually pretty good, but I found for my purposes, that having a physical keyboard to type on works better for me.I did eventually purchase a basic cover and keyboard combination for a little bit of protection and the ability to type while sitting on the couch with the device on my lap. I have basically turned my tablet into a laptop.Overall I am very happy with the function and operation of the device."
202,1.0 stars,"  You're taking a HUGE gamble if you purchase the Surface Pro 7. Microsoft clearly doesn't have great quality control, as detailed below, which is disappointing considering how expensive this is. Why they're aiming for college students who are in need of a reliable & affordable device is beyond me.It seemed well built at first glance - I loved the pen combo and it allowed me to quickly take notes & screenshot my ebooks for class.  However, I quickly ran into problems during setup. I was greeted by the blue screen of death after connecting to wifi...Okay...a bit concerning but the device restarted on its own with no issue. I began using it for homework and noticed a weird lag + it became very hot while opening programs and apps. Strange, but not hugely concerning...A day later when I go to wake it from sleep, I notice the face ID scanner turns on but the screen does not (see pics). I google how to reset the device using power and volume buttons... no dice. I plug in an external monitor and boom - as you can see from the pics, it displays on the external monitor but not on the device screen. I can only conclude the screen is defective and nothing I do will fix it. Restart/reset/power on/power off..NOTHING works.Needless to say, I returned it immediately as it lasted only 2 nights. Maybe I'm the only one with a defective product but this begs the question, ""How soon will this happen to other people down the road when their warranties or return windows are no longer open?"". There's only a 1 year warranty on this product and it cannot be repaired by normal means - they replace the entire thing instead. I implore you to research other options and carefully consider the reliability of the device you choose. I hope in the future companies stop choosing form over function and quit making disposable hardware."
203,5.0 stars,"  I have been looking at tablets, mainly to use with my music for when I play out, but hadn't considered a Surface Pro until it came up on VINE.  Hooray!  It's much more than a tablet.  I'm an Apple gal at home, but this Microsoft computer is very fast and flexible and can go anywhere with you.  It starts up very quickly and everything just pops up almost instantly.  (of course I don't have any large programs like Photoshop on it yet.)The 64 bit processor should handle anything. It took a little getting used to Microsoft again, but It wasn't bad.  Microsoft 10 seems to be better and more intuitive than previous versions I've used at work, still not as user friendly as my Apple, and I get lots of updates, but Microsoft is getting improving. The graphics are surprisingly good for such a small screen.  I watch movies and Netflix on it and they look great. It has a little fold out stand attached to the back so you can view it at an angle on your desk. You can buy the optional keyboard. pen and mouse.  I already had a spare keyboard and mouse so I didn't order them.  I have a small Acepen pad that I can use when I need the control of a pen. (If you are adding these I suggest a hub of some sort as the plug in slots are limited.)  I don't use any of them very much because the touch screen is so amazing.  You can also control it with your voice if you like and it'll talk back. I haven't used that feature much yet so I can't really say much about that aspect other than it's a bit like Siri.  This computer has lots of options for customization. It comes with a trial version of Microsoft Office suite, but fortunately I still had a an older version of Office that I uploaded.  It won't get updated, but I won't have to pay a monthly subscription either which still kinda irks me to be honest. I wish so many software companies weren't going that route.  The SP7 has several other useful programs preloaded and the games are fun. The display is plenty big for my music or for watching videos.  I have started using it, for my sheet music.  I have uploaded 400 songs and counting.  I found a program to manage them that I also love called Mobile Sheets.  It's everything I could have hoped for in a song library system.  Back to the Surface Pro 7.  It's small, thin and perfectly portable.  I ordered this case for some protection:  https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07VRXDC6H/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1It is a perfect fit and folds flat or can work with the built in stand of the Surface Pro 7. It is perfect for using on my music stand.  I also have a lap desk that I can set this computer on with keyboard and mouse.  It works really well or late night Netflix viewing. I don't know when I've had so much fun with a computer.  As I said in the beginning, I was looking for a basic tablet, but I got so much more with this Microsoft Surface Pro 7.  The downside of this machine is the price.  I would have never paid this much for a secondary computer, especially a non-Apple unit.  It has started to come down a bit in price so hopefully it will be a better deal soon.  Overall I'm very excited and happy to have this machine.  It has exceeded all my expectations."
204,5.0 stars,"  I set up the surface pro knowing nothing about it (I’ve only ever previously had an older iPad). I was pleasantly surprised that it’s basically your computer in tablet form!Set up was insanely quick and easy considering I already had a windows accountThe surface pro runs quick! I’ve had zero issues with lagging or slow downs. My husband loves using it to watch videos. The picture quality is excellent as wellI love how versatile it is in that it can be used as a tablet or as a laptop. I find myself wanting to get all of the accessories for it!Charging is pretty quick and I love how easy the cord connects to it, i don’t feel like I have to wrestle it (or like it’ll eventually wear out). It’s easily lasted us 8 hours of use per cycle."
205,2.0 stars,"  I'll keep it short and sweet and will only point out the problems and shortcomings that make absolutely hate my Surface Pro 7:1) as you can see from the photos I uploaded it gets REALLY hot, especially when plugged in, to 115-118 degrees routinely. Gets to about 108-110f when not plugged in.2) the battery life is about HALF of what it was on Surface pro 63) the gains in speed are non-existent really, no difference between the i7 processor I used to have4) slow SSD, previous surface showed same or greater performance numbers, same goes for ram5) the keyboard cover, when not used, continuously disconnects from the device and makes the screen rotate by disconnecting the autorotate sensor6) my device, matte black, scratches and dents way too easily and the scratches are highly visible. The keyboard cover is made of a material that seems to absorb all dirt around7) the keyboard cover is VERY flimsy and it's impossible to use it on your lap8) the usb-c port is kind of useless because the device doesn't come with any adapters, they have to be purchased separately.9) the following is true for all ms surface pro models: Speakers are tinny, the sound is simply weak and very quiet, both cameras are just trash, the touchscreen isn't very responsive, restart time without hibernate feature is about 35 seconds, which it shouldn't be because it's a brand new i7 with a supposedly-fast ssd.I'm very disappointed with this model. Before I bought it I was hoping that Intel's new 10nm processor would make my device faster and the battery last longer but it has the exact opposite effect!!! This is a downgrade, not an upgrade by any measure."
206,1.0 stars,"  Microsoft sucks. I thought they were the best.Here's the problem before the university started. I had purchase a Surface Pro 6 before starting school. Of course the guy at Best Buy said that the Surface Pro 6 was the best because he had one wrapped around his neck (but then again he wasn't going to school).So I purchased the Surface Pro 6 with all the bells and whistles over $1,000.During the first semester of school (August of 2019) the Surface Pro 6 had no updates everything was going fine. Then in February of 2020, I got an update once a month gradually to once a week from Microsoft updating windows and the Microsoft system.Now August 2020, I get updates once a day. I cannot finish my homework because Microsoft wants to update the Surface Pro 6.I try to get help from Microsoft but they can't answer my calls (I don't understand this because I'm sure Microsoft employees work from home) for the next 3 hours. And when I type in which takes time, my complaint is to no avail.I thought Microsoft was solid but they suck.During last semester they change the Microsoft Word and I had to keep on complaining to Microsoft on the Microsoft feedback which is a bunch of crap. At the time of my complaining the Microsoft Word was glitching and crashing (what gets me is I'm paying a monthly fee for the Microsoft 360 and yet it's terrible and the updates. I'm paying you a monthly fee and I never asked you to update my Microsoft Word just leave it at it is. If it ain't broke don't fix it.Just like with cell phones these companies want to update and take up all your internal memory so that you can go back and say my computer doesn't work and then they want you to either upgrade or to buy a new computer.My friend bought an HP from Best Buy for only $300 brand new. A little bit bigger than my Surface Pro 6 and she's had no updates from Microsoft even though she has Windows for her system.I'm telling everybody right now don't buy Microsoft.Because of the frustration during my homework time and examinations which is stressful, I am going to make it my lifetime goal to place on every review this dissatisfaction with Microsoft.I am also going to copy this and paste it on Surface Pro 6 reviews and on any Surface Pro products on amazon.com reviews. In addition, I'm going to file a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission for them to investigate to see if Microsoft is updating for monetary gain against the consumer.Bill Gates needs to get off his covid-19 and political ambitions and start refocusing on his products. I feel that there was a change in administration hands during 2020 and that is why Microsoft has gone to the dogs.If your product is solid then why are you updating so much. I have had 3 laptops in my lifetime and none of them gave me problems with updates or glitches or crashes like the Surface Pro 6. So to me there's no need for updating this is just some kind of marketing or monetary scheme. Or the surface pro's are junk.MY SCHOOLING IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME AND IF YOUR PRODUCT CAN'T CUT IT THEN YOU SHOULDN'T BE SELLING IT TO STUDENTS WHO ARE STRUGGLING!P.S. don't say you're sorry or you're concerned with my dilemma because you're not. Do me a favor in any other consumer and fire whoever's in charge of the Surface Pro. And quit screwing around with Microsoft Word again if it ain't broken don't fix it."
207,5.0 stars,"  This computer is not so much a tablet as a light laptop.  With an i7 chip and a 256 gb, this machine has as much memory as my laptop, and it's faster.  From the picture, I thought it came with a keyboard.  It did not, and I was disappointed about the extra expense.  However, it needs some sort of cover and I wanted a keyboard.  Microsoft's Signature type case cover fulfills both functions, and it is an excellent keyboard.  The keyboard fits magnetically onto the bottom of the SP, but it is easily detachable.  I also got a case for additional protection.  In fact, it is easy to use the SP's touch screen as a keypad for typing the same way one types on a smart phone.  The SP works fine as a tablet;  I detach the Signature keyboard and use it to read a book.  (Actually, the keyboard can be folded behind the SP as well.)  I downloaded my wordprocessing program (NotaBene Lingua), and it runs perfectly on this machine.  I prefer travelling with this machine over my laptop because it is so much lighter than the laptop.  I can open the laptop on a plane, but the SP is much easier.  The SP's screen is terrific.  I prefer it for watching movies over my laptop and desktop screens, even though it is smaller.  I like the touch screen, though I don't use it that often.  For me, the surface pro is basically a light laptop.  Using it is like using a laptop.  There is room for one USB device.  I usually attach a hard drive.  There is also a USB  C port.  The Amazon product page says USB C port should be good for ""accessory charging.""  I tried charging the SP through it, but it didn't work. There is a place for wired earphones, but the bluetooth system  is what I usually use to listen to music and films.  The charger that comes with the SP has an unusual connection.  It works well, but it has no light to indicate when the SP is fully charged.  The light comes on to indicate the SP is charging, and there is an icon on the screen that tells you when it is fully charged, but I would want to know before I turned it on.  My only reservation about the SP is the battery.  It does not hold a charge very long.  I'd compare to using a smart phone.  You can use it a lot, but you're always looking for a charger."
208,4.0 stars,"  I wanted to use this for at least 30 days before giving a review, just to be fair, and I haven't used a tablet in a while. so needed to get familiar with it.  I use my desktop for just about everything (Dell 7020 i5), and have been using Windows 7 forever.  The thought of being forced over to Windows 10 is disturbing to me, especially with all the security issues Microsoft has been having with updates lately.  Granted, I'm not rich, and not running any municipalities on my PC, so don't have anything hackers would be after, but don't want my PC freezing up with a screen telling me it's gonna cost me $300 bucks to unlock my computer.  Anyways, I'm down to 9 days left with 7 before security updates end for it, so Windows 10 had to be learned to use.  This has Windows 10 Home edition installed, you can pay to upgrade if you want to do it legally.  It'll take me longer than 30 days to get used to it, as did 7 when I first started with it years ago.  This tablet is fast, with the Intel i7 inside, and performs all the tasks I need it to do.  16GB memory is great, letting you perform multiple things at once, and I have not experienced one problem with freezing up or lagging from to much going on at once.  A 256GB SSD is built in, and plenty of storage, and the ability of plugging in an exterior hard drive makes storage nearly unlimited.  There is one USB port, one USB-C port, and a headphone jack, giving you options to plug in multiple accessories.  It comes with a charging cord that plugs in magnetically, and lights up so you know its connected.  Speakers are pretty decent for a tablet, and louder, with clear sound than I expected them to be (at least for me, at 60+ years old, I don't listen to music as loud as I used to in the 70's, and Zeppelin is just as good with the volume a little lower!).  It has the standard power button next to the volume +/-  button, all built in to a matte black housing.  The tablet itself is pretty hefty, and I was surprised at the weight.  It's solid, but heavier than expected it to be.  The bezel is a big issue for many.  Phones and PC monitors are going towards near invisible bezels, and this tablet design is nowhere near a thin bezel, and quite wide.  When the tablet is 12.3"",  every square pixel is prime real estate, and the bezel eats up a lot of it.There are plenty of ways to personalize this tablet, and way to many to go into here without writing a small book.  I found I could personalize this nicely, and almost anything I wanted to add, view, save, or run was not beyond it's capabilities.  One big issue I found was the ability to run Firefox, or some other non Microsoft software or programs.  But Firefox is a big thing for me.  I've been using it for quite a while, without issue on any device, until the Surface Pro (and I'm not alone here, many have the same problem).  Firefox constantly will freeze up, stop working altogether, or any number of unexpected issues I never had anywhere else, and seems Microsoft wants you to use Edge over anything else.  When you spend this much for a tablet, or any device for that matter, it should be able to run whatever browser you want to use, as long as it meets the criteria for running it, and not have built in (whatever) that causes this issue to happen.  I found Chrome will work fine, and will automatically update itself to 64 bit to run the correct version with Surface Pro.  It also seems to be getting easier to run Chrome apps, as well as Android apps on here, and I've had very little issues with any I've tried, without having to run anything rooted, or with any app to help make them work (like Bluestacks).  I think almost every Surface Pro before this one had issues running any of this, but since the release of this model, or at least in 2019, Microsoft is working with Google, and developing apps and software to run on/with both platforms, a huge benefit to users everywhere.  The Windows 10 app store is limited as to what's available, and the ability to download from Google Play, without having to monkey around finding backwater ways of doing it, is awesome.  Google Play, as almost anyone with an Android device knows, has almost endless lists of apps, with better quality apps being developed all the time since Google has demanded more and more from developers.  Another issue is battery life.  Obviously, this is dependent on what's running, what's running in the background, and how much you use it.  I found that even with not much running at all (including background), I don't get the 10.5 hours battery life out of it before it needs recharged.  I do find that a recharge to 100% from below 10-15% is fairly quick, and now I usually just use this while it's plugged in.  About the charger, there is a new one from Microsoft that not only has a port for charging USB devices built into it, but also sports an Ethernet port as well.  I got the one that has the USB port only, and use it to charge my phone when needed.  The new charger is a nice little device, and easily connects this to Ethernet if you have it available.  Sells for an average of about $60 bucks, depending where you look.  Also, this does not include the Microsoft Keyboard Cover, or any Surface Pen.  I have not obtained either yet, but have tried cheaper stylus pens.  All have failed miserably on here, but when I had a chance to try a certified Microsoft pen, it worked beautifully.  Not having a keyboard and pen included with this, is like trying to run a sprint race with a broken ankle.  You can run, but definitely not at your full potential.  Why a tablet at this price doesn't include even a low end version of each is beyond me.  It would give the buyer a chance to see how this works when it is complete with the two essentials it's missing, and encourage them to upgrade to something better.  When spending $1400 bucks, even if they had to add another $50 bucks to just cover their cost of adding a pen and keyboard/cover, how many wouldn't pay the extra $50 if they decided to spend this much already for the tablet?  Also built in are a 5MP and 8MP camera, front and rear respectively, and the camera takes pretty decent pics for mediocre MP cameras.  A webcam is also present  for those who use one.  I personally do not, and can't give any sort of review of how well it works.  All I know about webcams is that I constantly read horror stories of people having the cams hacked, and being spied on and never knowing it.  When I first got this, and saw that red light looking at me where the webcam is, I immediately got a cover for it.  I doubt anyone is interested in spying on an old man like me, and hacking into my webcam, but this world is full of those ""people"", lurking and living in their parents basements (we're talking about 30-50 year olds, not teenagers here), who spend their days inventing ways of hacking into everything, and if the largest corp. in the world can't keep them out, what chance do I have.  Anyways, it's covered up.  Don't want to see pics of me in my white boxers with hearts on them on the internet one day.  The shame alone would do me in.There is a lot to review on the Surface Pro 7, and I could go on and on, but want to keep this within reason where you won't get bored and just leave.  This sells for $1,399.00 (as of this review, with Intel core i7, 16GB ram and 256GB SSD), and a lot of money for a tablet, with no keyboard and pen included.  Granted, this model, with Intel i7, 16GB Ram, and 256 SSD, definitely builds the price way up their, but their are many alternatives to this same model Surface Pro, and different configurations can bring the price higher or lower, depending on what you want in it (or can afford).  Overall, it's a great tablet, and works fantastically at lightening speed if you use what Microsoft wants you to use to run with it.  The price of this model alone will keep many from being able to purchase it, but those who can, will get a high end tablet that can compete with Samsung head to head ( at this price range), and have the ability to do so much with it.  The best tablet I've ever owned, runs faster then my Dell i5 desktop (although i5 is still pretty fast), and a pleasure to own.  It should last a long time, and hopefully can updated for continual use for the next several years."
209,5.0 stars,"  While many other people are considering and comparing whether or not they should upgrade their surface pro to this one, this is my first experience with one and I'm beyond pleased with it. It works so well! It's everything you'd want in a tablet, and everything you would want in a laptop, all in one device.Normally if you get a tablet like an iPad, you're not going to have all the same features like you would with a laptop. Tablets tend to have their own strengths and tasks they do them well, then just have add on's to make them work like laptops. And laptops have features they can make them more portable, with tablet-like software and lighter designs. But the Surface Pro is a true marriage of the two. It's an amazing tablet, but also a full featured, powerful computer. I love it.All the software I've used with this has ran smoothly and everything I work on responds quickly. It's thin enough that traveling with it is easy. Not at all as heavy as a typical laptop. But it still has a nice size, bright screen so it's easy to work on.It's just hard to even think of ways this could be improved upon. Whether you're a tablet person or a computer person, this is a device for everyone."
210,5.0 stars,"  Touchscreen is excellent. Battery life is excellent when considering its power (i7 16Gb ram) -- Fan is amazing at keeping it cool. Its a super powerful little laptop/drawer.I used it for progamming. Writing memos and design proposals, drawing, taking notes, you name it!Do yourself a favor and get Autodesk: SketchAlso move the taskbar to the left or top so you dont press it by accident while writing.ALSO -- contrary to what you may have heard, it CERTAINLY charges via the USB-C (and probably faster than its own adapter). Dont use a dinky phone charger like the other people -- use a proper USB-C laptop charger. I use my HP 65Watt USB-C charger that powers my wife's macbook pro, works like a charm.Typecover is a must. And I actually find it comfier to type on my lap than a laptop.Only con which I could care less about is that the camera is soso -- like a phone cam. Maybe the camera itself is good by the software blows? IDK IDC."
211,5.0 stars,"  I've been playing around with this Surface Pro for a few weeks now. I am very accustomed to the more traditional laptop form factor, but when I got the chance to try out this Surface I decided to give it a shot.Overall as a tablet this thing is top notch. It has a formidable amount of processing power, RAM, and storage, allowing it to do anything you might want a PC to do, in the size and shape of a large tablet. It's great for web browsing, watching videos, reading news, basically anything that doesn't require much typing.I am very impressed by the hinge on the back of the device. It's a super thin mechanism, but it has the strength and stability to allow you to prop the tablet up on a table in basically any angle you like. Some serious engineering effort must have gone into that, and I tip my hat to the people who made it happen.For me, I don't think this could replace my laptop. I wanted it to work out, but I find the tablet shape to be a bit too constraining for the amount of typing I do. The on-screen keyboard suffers from the same low maximum speed as all on-screen keyboards do. I was able to use the device on a desk hooked up to a USB keyboard just fine, and in this setting it could work just as well as any other computer on a desk. That doesn't really translate well into usage from a couch or armchair though. I need a solid physical keyboard in that setting, and even a tablet case with a built-in keyboard just isn't the same as a real laptop computer.While this didn't really get the job done for me, I could see its light weight and touch screen being a real asset for a lot of people."
212,4.0 stars,"  I really like the functionality of this tablet, and the fast speeds it can do things. It runs windows, so be prepared for lots of updates all the time.Battery life so far has been about 6 hours with nonstop use. I mostly use this for designing graphics in photoshop and lightroom, and not surfing the web.However, do yourself a favor and get the keyboard and pen with this. You will have far more usage out of it with those two extra items. A wireless mouse would also be a great addition, making this a nice small laptop!"
213,5.0 stars,"  This review is for the Microsoft Surface Pro 7 - 12.3"" Touch-Screen - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - 256GB Solid State Drive (Latest Model) - Matte BlackThis new Microsoft Surface Pro 7 arrived well packaged and protected. The delivery was direct to my door by an Amazon driver and I had to sign for it because of its high value. The outer carton was in good shape and the product box was in excellent condition. The packaging is classy and befits a high price piece of hardware. I was enthusiastic about the rapid deployment of this Surface Pr0 from unpacking to start up and on to familiarization. My most used computers are a 15 inch Samsung Windows 7 LapTop with a Core i7 Intel chip and an Apple iPad. The former has Windows 7 installed and up to date. The latter has Apple IOS also up to date. I had not used Windows 10 until starting up this new Surface Pro 7.It took me an hour to set password and PIN and to set the date and clock time and to go on line to have Microsoft update the software in my unit. There are ample tips and suggestions. For the most part, I found the Windows 10 operating system intuitive and relatively easy to learn and to use. The unit came with choices of security software. I installed Norton Safe Web and was not asked to pay for it or warned about a future cost. As I use it more and more, I expect I will choose a best security suite and may elect to install IBM Trusteer. The standalone tablet with its touch screen has limited appeal for me when it comes to volume use such as major photo editing or drafting reports and letters. So, I paid a visit to the local Microsoft Store.The staff in the Microsoft store were enthusiastic about the Surface Pro 7 and eager to show and tell me its features and set me up to try a unit with a Keypad Cover and a neat Mouse that folds flat but opens as a highly ergonomic mouse and couples instantly to the Surface Pro. I also played with the Stylus. I decided to purchase a Keypad Cover in black and a mouse. The Surface Pro feels like a laptop with these additions. You have the choice of using the mouse pad or the separate wireless mouse or the touch screen for moving about the desktop, selecting, cut and paste and all other actions. The keypad has backlighted keys and is a pleasure to use for rapid typing. When closed the Keypad Cover protects the screen. The cover deploys easily and the screen angle may be set in many positions to ease viewing, defeat glare and more. These two devices cost me $185, but I feel they were well worth the money.The unit boots up faster than any previous computer I have owned. The screen is gorgeous. The Surface Pro 7 loads and plays videos without stalling or pausing to fill a buffer. I have yet to see a black or blue data failure screen after many hours of use. I was easily able to access Microsoft’s One Drive to use for back up and cloud storage. I was also able to easily access Apple iCloud and to download photos, read my Apple email and function smoothly in the Apple environment. I was able to delete images from my iPhone and iPad using the iCloud It was important to me to be able to function in both the Apple and the Windows 10 environments and this unit met my expectations.The software suite and the configuration of Windows 10 will be a learning curve for me, but there seem to be adequate tips and FAQs. I will have to decide if I want to pay an annual $99 for Windows 365 (Word, Excel, etc Suite) or use a much less expensive or free set of Apps for office work. The trend seems to be headed in the direction of subscription software; Photoshop requires an annual fee now. It will take me some time to master this Surface Pro and set it up the way that I find most productive, but I am confident it will serve me well for years to come. One Drive – the Cloud storage and retrieval system – holds promise of freeing me from making backups to local hard drives. The unit has two USB ports, A and C, making it flexible to couple to many devices. There is a headphone jack, a front camera, a rear camera, a physical on/off button, a physical volume rocker control switch and a magnetic plug in port for the charger. The unit will run all day long on a charge. It is thin and light weight and fits well in my messenger bag. When roaming, I prefer to use cellular data via LTE rather than risk a compromised wireless network. The Surface Pro is supposed to have a SIM chip installed, but I have not tried this yet. Time will tell. But, this capable computer gets a 5 from me."
214,5.0 stars,"  Received this in two days with my Prime student account. Everything arrived okay, no issues there. I am a sophomore at a university and I needed laptop because I had transferred to this new institution and the commute is around 45 minutes. I bought this solely for productivity purposes such as school work. Here are the pros and cons.Pros:- Beautiful design: I really wanted something minimalist and this is perfect. I bought the Surface type cover as well and it really goes well with the design, absolutely love the magnetic attachment.- Portability: Like I said, my commute is around 45 mins to get to school and 45 mins to get back. Because of this, most of my time is going to be spent at school, away from my desktop, so I wanted something portable and that could fit in my book bag. The Surface Pro 7 is the perfect solution! With the keyboard you can simply lift it up to cover the screen of the surface and it automatically goes to Sleep mode. It fits perfectly in my medium-sized Jansport backpack as well. Not to mention, the keyboard's material is amazing! Definitely recommend getting the keyboard along with the Surface (it has backlit keys too)!- Hardware: 10th Gen Intel processor, and you can choose whether to get the i5 or i7 (not sure if i3 is an option). I went with the i5 because I purchased an i7 for my desktop and realized it was actually overkill. Even with gaming on my desktop an i5 would've gotten the job done well at a lower cost. Also, as much as I wanted to get the 16GB RAM model for the Surface, I was on a budget so I had to go with the 8GB RAM. Even then, it can handle Spotify, CodeBlocks (coding IDE), and Google Chrome open with quite a few tabs such as email, YouTube, school portals, etc. and still function quite well, which is the most I'd need for it to do.- Crisp display: Everything just looks clean! Shows and movies on Netflix look so crisp, scrolling through websites using the touchscreen is super smooth; everything just looks sharp. Some people were reporting issues of screen flickering and I had that a little bit while watching Netflix but I forgot to apply a Windows update and that fixed it up. After that, no display/screen issues whatsoever.Cons:- Battery life: The battery life isn't the best. I haven't done any time measurements but I notice that it tends to lose battery rather quickly, I'd guesstimate around maybe 7 hours of battery life? I believe they were advertising around 11 hours which seems pretty absurd, but luckily I keep my charger around so it hasn't been too much of a problem but it's just something you have to deal with.- Camera: The camera is straight weird. It has this weird smudgy-looking filter effect (kind of). It's strange and I haven't tested it out in video calls or anything but to be honest I won't be needing the camera much except for taking online assignments where a webcam is required.All in all, I am in love with this thing. I take it EVERYWHERE and I'm always finding an excuse to pull it out and work on something. You know you have something made of quality when everyone in the room is asking, ""Is that a Surface?"" or, ""What kind of laptop is that?"". I've received a lot of comments already and my brother, who purchased an Asus VivoBook already wants to sell it to help him upgrade to a Surface, LOL! This thing just attracts attention and with good reason.Despite the couple issues I mentioned, I still highly recommend this device. This is perfect for college students, and I've even seen graduate/medical school students using it! Regardless of your needs, I'm sure the Surface can deliver."
215,5.0 stars,  Very impressed with this product. I recently took it on vacation with me and it was wonderful to watch tv on and play music. The graphics are great and the sound is superb. I want to get the pen that goes with it but haven't had a chance. It is not lightweight nor heavy but rather sturdy. I bought a screen protector for it and it works really well. The touch screen sensitivity is pretty great. I have not had any problems so fR and am enjoying using this for the basic tasks that I use it for. If it lasts I will pass it on to my kids.
216,2.0 stars,"  I was really excited about this device. It has sleek design, the screen looks great, it works like a charm with the Microsoft keyboard and mouse. Overall, I am a fan of this device, HOWEVER...The this computer crashes with no warning. I could be doing things as simple as just using a web browser. The screen goes blank, I have to press the unlock button and the computer starts like it is newly booted. When I get back in everything I was doing was lost (screens were closed, unsaved work gone). It is like the computer decides to shut down at random by itself. Sometimes it can go days with out issues and then sometimes it crashes multiple times in one day.From what I can tell Microsoft has no fix and/or does does not care about it. This is also not just a problem with my specific device. I had purchased a refurbished pro 6 and experienced these exact problems. I thought it was an issue with a bad refurbishment so I returned the Pro 6 and purchased a brand new Pro 7. Now it is having the same problems. Even more, if you go to Microsoft discussion boards there are TONS of other people who have expressed concerns about this same issue. Quite infuriating to be honest.If you haven't purchased one yet I would highly recommend reconsidering unless you feel like you wouldn't be bothered by your computer likely crashing. If mine wasn't conveniently out of the return limit I would. Now I'm stuck with an expensive, sleek, faulty device."
217,4.0 stars,"  I'm a CAD designer and I work in the AEC industry (AEC = architecture, engineering and construction). I have longed for a touch screen tablet style of computer with a pen/stylus that can write, draw and generally sketch in a natural and fluid way - the same way a normal ink pen writes on paper. Now obviously an ink pen on paper cannot be 100% replicated on a screen, however do not let that fool you. The Surface Pro 7, with the $99 Surface Pen, and the program Drawboard PDF, is without a doubt the closest thing you can get to redlining and marking up PDF's on a tablet - hands down. Nothing else comes close. But you cannot do this with Bluebeam - it must be with Drawboard PDF. Bluebeam needs a lot of work to get it to be as good as Drawboard PDF.The screen is beautiful. The kickstand is perfect, even folds back to almost flat, where the tablet is about a 5° rise above a flat desk/table for a very natural position when you're going to town on hand writing with the Pen. The Pen and pressure sensitivity is exactly where it needs to be. So fluid and spot on. The Surface and Windows know when your palm is resting on the screen so it never is a problem. I've used my Surface now for two weeks solid and zero issues with the palm resting on the screen.If you're in the AEC industry and looking for a great redline and markup tool, you must use Drawboard PDF. I've tried about 8 other programs, including Bluebeam, and nothing comes close.I also bought the Microsoft Dock for this thing and it's replaced my normal computer. I bought the i5 with 8GB RAM and I have had no performance issues. I have Navisworks Manage installed and it even handles relatively large models okay. I have not installed Revit and I won't, only to deter myself from modeling on this laptop. I'm more of a management role now and need to stay that way.If you are in fact a CAD or Revit designer, this probably would not replace your machine totally, but as a secondary unit to take with you to the field, to meetings, or to use as a replacement for paper - this is 100% your machine. Hope this review was helpful to those in the industry."
218,2.0 stars,"  Had a surface 2 prior. Keyboard was so frustrating I eventually snapped it in half. Didn’t fix the problem by rev 7. Will be typing along and boom the cursor is now somewhere else two paragraphs previous and now I have to fix it, if I even noticed. I spend most of my time fixing the writing, rather that writing the writing. Very hard to write with. I suspect the connection to the tablet itself. So buy and use another keyboard. I go down to my 10 year old dell win7 machine if I want to write just to avoid the frustration.Bought top of the line I7 version. Can’t sandbox anything. If you browse for any period of time, it will freeze up regularly. Unfreezes any where from 5-20 seconds later, but this is a flag ship product. Freezing the whole system while ads load in the browser is unacceptable.The face recognition login is awesome."
219,1.0 stars,"  If you are going to buy, proceed with caution. Make sure the model you receive is in fact the configuration advertised. Read the reviews, plenty of people saying they received a Surface Pro 6, not a 7. Remember 7 has USB-C, 6 does not, if yours doesn’t have USB-C guess what? You’ve been bamboozled!"
220,3.0 stars,"  I love the whole two in one windows feature. This is a real laptop (using one program at the time), all programs can be install and that is great. The issue is that it does not perform under a what a call a medium level work out. I have the core i5, 8GB with the 128GB storage. I bought this to work in a school setting. Well for all those who are thinking this is great for Zoom, browser and say Word or Onenote together, for get it. This get really hot quickly and it will crash on you. I am working from my replacement surface and things are the same. You need a fan behind so that you can cool it down. And yes I know the ones with corei7 have a built in fan but I really don't think it should under perform with 3 applications open."
221,2.0 stars,"  Microsoft has the worst customer service I have ever encountered.  The power cord worked sporadically out of the box and they were unwilling to send a replacement without first getting the original power cord back.  After waiting 10 days for their shipping label so I could return the original power cord, I spent 2 hours with their customer service team who admitted they made a mistake when opening up a case for the defect.  My only option was to then wait another 6-10 days for shipping label, then wait another 2 weeks to get a replacement.  My surface was unusable because it couldn't be charged and Microsoft was unwilling to send a replacement without the delays described above.  I will not ever buy another Microsoft computer again.  ."
222,2.0 stars,"  I loved the Surface, until now.  Unfortunately, the touch screen has stopped working.  I have brought it to see what can be done, told to factory reset, did it, worked for a day, and now not working again.I am sure I would have had this issue sooner, but haven't used a lot during the pandemic.  I bought it because of the touch screen feature.  Went on-line to see a fix, and see that this is bigger issue then I realized.  Lots of people talking about it.The speed, color on screen is amazing.I am so disappointed, as I really did like this Surface Pro."
223,1.0 stars,"  As you can see from the pictures, the internal battery is expanded abnormally.  It expended so bad and popped up the touch screen.  I can put a finger inside the gap, that's how bad it is.Be safe."
224,1.0 stars,"  Microsoft continues its age old tradition of making devices unusable through updates. I lost a lot of data and effort because an update was incompatible with bit locker encryption and Windows didn't catch it, downloaded it, and applied it when I restarted. The result is a big loss of data that will impact my work. Incredibly disappointed with this shoddy craftsmanship on M$'s part and will be considering a switch to MacOS for all my work devices."
225,1.0 stars,  when use.. in top of screen have some stain i think the screen damage because come and go..
226,5.0 stars,"  I've been a fan of the Microsoft Surface Pro lines since its inception. Not much of a difference between the Surface Pro 6 and this Surface Pro 7 though. Appreciate the newly added USB-C port but Microsoft should've already had it on the Surface Pro 6. Overall, great product all around."
227,1.0 stars,"  Proceed with absolute caution when considering a Surface Pro. The Surface Pro 4's are dropping like flies suffering from bulging batteries and there is no clear indication that this problem does not exist in later models. Microsoft have completely washed their hands of the problem although, by their own admission, this problem can be hazardous and the machine should not be used when it happens. Personally  I would not risk another Microsoft Surface Pro product with this problem hanging over my head."
228,1.0 stars,"  Bought a Surface Pro 3 Laptop.  After 3 months, suddenly screen went dim.  I cannot do anything that requires going to the screen because it is too dim to see anything.  I'm not computer savvy and this makes the laptop totally useless.  My rating is zero stars."
229,4.0 stars,"  so reason for 4 not 5 is it has locked up on me a few times and sucks there is no sim card other than that super fast, great picture quality, and the built in stand is great"
230,1.0 stars,"  Item shown with keyboard and it does not include it for $595.  The keyboard is $150 or $200 more.

233,1.0 stars,  Too much money
234,1.0 stars,"  Why is this product almost 100$ cheaper than best buy tablet? I purchased a new one, so should I be getting a new tablet and not a new refurbished one if that makes any sense? Wondering due to reviews and price difference. Placing 1 star to uncertainty at this point"
235,1.0 stars,"  Absolutely useless as a tablet. The touchscreen is terrible and unresponsive, and the on-screen keyboard takes forever to show up or doesn't show up at all.If you absolutely need a tablet, DO NOT BUY A MICROSOFT SURFACE."

239,3.0 stars,"  Is this a good tablet that gets the job done? Yes, but for and over $1000 Microsoft product, I seriously expected a better experience. The display is gorgeous and the touch screen is great, but the performance is very adequate. I get smoother performances on my $400 android tablet. The scrolling is often choppy, Google Chrome doesn't really run very well, and it overheats to extreme levels when its charging. you almost can't even use it while charging because it gets so hot and freezes a lot. Seriously considering returning it.Almost forgot, but the kickstand became wobbly after the first day. it feels very cheap."
240,1.0 stars,"  Mostly unusable. So choppy, laggy and crashes when browsing the internet too.The face recognition software is god awful"
241,5.0 stars,"  This SurfacePro 7 16Gb RAM /1 Tb memory supplements a SurfacePro 4 16Gb RAM 256Gb memory, in which the battery back puffed up and prevents the screen from sitting on the body. The lesson may be, read the fine print that says don't leaved it plugged in 24/7. Speed on calculation-intensive apps is noticeably faster. Keyboard for older machine works fine with this one, the side-bar docking station does not and required upgrade (cheap though). Face recognition signin software stopped working after two weeks, haven't figured out how to restore it.Bought this model while deciding necessary memory, when Amazon suddenly equalized price of 500Gb and 1Tb.models. 500Gb is likely sufficient for working apps. The extra space is useful for (1) main family photo album, as it allows faster editing of files, which are then backed up to external drives and Dropbox, (2) larger on-board sample of iTunes library, formerly kept on external USB drive.HINT: Value for money was better when I was stateside and paid a better base price, with no HST. Subjunctively, if you were to get a friend to do the same and send it marked 'gift', you'd be ahead. Otherwise, US fees are prohibitive."
242,1.0 stars,"  When it works, this tablet is really good. It's fast, touchscreen works perfectly, good screen resolution, keyboard and pen are fantastic.The problem, which seems to happen a lot when I look at issues reported by users on Internet, is that once in a while, when you boot the tablet, it goes into a buggy boot loop.  Windows logo appears, but keeps flashing, and nothing else happens.  I contacted Microsoft.  The answer I got is this:1. Do a hard reboot (press and hold the start button for more than 20 seconds to shutdown the tablet, and press start again)2. If it still occurs, re-install Window.I do step one, at least once every week.  But once in a while, the hard reboot corrupts Windows (blue screen of death), and I have to reinstall Windows from scratch (full restoration).  How can you rely on a machine if you risk having to  reinstall Windows each time you turn it on?  Imagine if it happens when you need your tablet the most.My guess is that it's a firmware problem, because it occurs only when you turn on the tablet.  Restarting Windows from the OS never cause this problem.  Microsoft never acknowledged the problem, and no firmware updates were released to correct this.I now use my trusty Dell laptop when I need something reliable.  It's bulky, but it never failed me.  I only use the Suface when I need to use a software with a pen.If you don't need a pen, do not buy the Surface.  Keep your money for something reliable (maybe an iPad Pro, if the software you need runs on IOS)."
243,4.0 stars,"  Como una computadora secundaria o tables es genial. Es rápido, cómoda y funcional. Es una gran opción cuando se busca algo intermedio entre laptop y tablet. Muy recomendable para la universidad, trabajo y hasta oscio. La pantalla se ve muy bien, la función con la Sueface Pen es muy comoda y útil, el teclado es casi idéntico a una laptop normal y el que tenga puertos USB lo vuelve todavía mejor.El único detalle y por el cual no puedo ponerle 5 estrellas es que se calienta demasiado a mi gusto (más que mi Laptop u otra tablet pero no en exceso) y la batería no dura tanto como uno esperaría (me dura 3 - 4 horas aproximadamente en modo ahorro de bateria).Yo la uso para el trabajo y con la herramienta de conectar de Windows 10 me permite usarla como un segundo monitor lo cual es genial.No la recomiendo para largas horas de trabajo o viajes largos (como un vuelo intercontinental)."
244,1.0 stars,"  Camera worked on initial app/office etc load - actually did two video calls (WhatsApp & Zoom) - next morning -  regardless of all MS troubleshooting efforts (driver reloads etc), continually got ""Camera Not Installed"" messages.Good on Amazon re no hassle return... BUT.... what a waste of time!"
245,5.0 stars,  Très satisfait de mon achat exactement ce que je recherchaisVient en remplacement de mon portable et de mon ancienne tablette
246,3.0 stars,"  J'avais une surface pro 6 avant et si je l'aurais eu encore le saut n'en aurait pas valu la peine. Sur ce modèle souvent le wifi bloque je dois relancer la carte wifi de façon aléatoire, le chargeur décide de ne plus charger donc même brancher la surface passes en mode batterie Le pire je ne pense pas avoir eu un citron je retrouve plein de commentaire sur ces problèmes sur le web.. Bref sinon très bonne machine. Autre point négatif je trouve ça dommage que Microsoft pour avoir la version toute noire il faut payer plus cher pour obtenir la version 256go qui est pas mal plus cher et m'étais pas accessible.."
247,5.0 stars,"  well I had read the comments and I was worried about receiving a wrong version of surface products, but I can assure you at least, mine was the right one!However, I had many problems with Amazon customer services and career company but the product is fine with fare power and acceptable abilities!"
248,4.0 stars,"  Je suis très satisfaite du rapport qualité-prix. Une excellente alternative à un laptop. J’ai un bug avec la reconnaissance faciale (la caméra resté allumée) alors j’ai désactivé et utilise le nip. Sinon, pour les personnes comme moi, qui ont besoin professionnel et pas des gamers ou des graphistes, cette tablette i3 128 est parfaite. J’apprécie aussi de pouvoir ajouté de la mémoire avec une micropuce."
249,5.0 stars,"  La surface pro 7 de 128 gb tiene un rendimiento muy bueno. Esteticamente es una joya, se maneja muy facil al tacto.Si bien no es de uso rudo, es decir con programas para programación, pesados o para gamers no creo que sea lo mejor, pero para un uso de oficina, paquete de office, internet correos vida diaria funciona a la perfección. La bateria rinde bien y la carga con USB - C le da una ventaja brutal (evidentemente no con un cargador de celular, si no con el de una mac o con el nintendo switch, carga bastante bien). Muy contento con este equipo, esteticamente repito que es una joya aunque si se ve fragil y es preferible una case que ya lo hacen que la puedas cargar donde quieras."

251,5.0 stars,"  Love it, make sure get a UAG case!"
252,5.0 stars,"  Its a tablet, with all laptop functions. And tons of power, with no lags. My two boys got them_one two years ago, one latest model_ when they got into university, and use them with the keypads with full laptop functionality. They have no complaints in using office and all accounting and data apps. Have added optical mouse for both, and the accounting guy added a 23"" monitor through one of the ports for large spreadsheets. Excellent for online class work, assignments, tests and quizes and live group meetings."
253,3.0 stars,  When are they going to offer LTE in all their Surface versions?And why do they charge so much money for SSD and RAM increments. Feels like gouging!
254,5.0 stars,"  Ya era fan de Surface, pero cada vez viene mejor. Desde la versión 6 en negro, están increíbles. Llegó muy rápido y en perfectas condiciones."
255,1.0 stars,  paid top dollars for this 16gb ram 1tb ssd microsoft surface pro 7 cant seems to switch on right from unboxing it even after charging over 10 hrs. For a $3000 unit wasn't expecting to be this bad definitely not worth it comparing to so many options out there that cost 1/3 of the price.
256,3.0 stars,"  I'll admit, it's a cool tablet and weird to think it runs Windows but overall it's a very attractive product.  I had no problems with its performance but the 10hr battery only lasted 3-4 hours and it got extremely hot on the bottom.  I just get the feeling this thing is over stressed and will die quickly and for the price, not worth the risk."
257,3.0 stars,"  La tablet funciona muy bien en casi todos los sentidos, sin embargo en mi caso la reproducción de música es terrible, constantemente cuando reproduces música, no importa por cual reproductor o salida uses, deja de reproducir por  un segundo o menos, por múltiple ocasiones dando como resultado la peor experiencia de usuario para aquellos que escuchan música mientras trabajan.."
258,5.0 stars,"  As a teacher, it was very smooth to do the transition from physical mode of teaching to online one. Pro 7 is fast with stylus to write easily on the screen. Keyboard is also a good addition, if one has to type the document. The only issue is that stylus pen and Keyboard are sold separately and a bit costly too."
259,3.0 stars,"  great slim product, but still ridiculously overpriced. Entry level macbooks are now cheaper than this"
